<h2 id="c1"><span>EDITOR&rsquo;S NOTE</span></h2>
<p>This book, assembling the musical writings of Philip Hale, draws
principally upon the programme books for which he wrote descriptive
notes for thirty-two years of concerts by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra. Since the notes were addressed to audiences
approaching the music with, presumably, open minds, the writer
judiciously withheld his individual opinion. This opinion he freely
expressed in his newspaper reviews of the same concerts, extending
over an even longer period, and it has seemed advisable, by
combining the two, to bring together the critic and the historian.
The editor has found, in the newspaper files, pertinent critical paragraphs
which are here used to introduce the programme notes
about each particular work. The transition from criticism to descriptive
note is indicated by a typographical ornament.</p>
<p>In going through the scrapbooks in the Allen A. Brown Room
of the Boston Public Library, wherein the newspaper criticisms of
Philip Hale&rsquo;s forty active years are carefully preserved, the editor
came across this observation by him, in the Boston <i>Herald</i> of
March 13, 1912: &ldquo;In 1945 some student in the Brown Room of the
Public Library will doubtless be amused by opinions expressed by
us all, of works first heard in 1912. Some of us will not then be
disturbed by his laughter or by quotations ornamented with exclamation
marks of contempt or wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is cause for wonder, to a student at a time ten years short
of the year Mr. Hale mentioned; wonder, however, at his quick
perception of essential values upon first hearing what time has
since proved a masterpiece, or considerably less than a masterpiece,
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
as the case may be. Few indeed are the professional judges of
music who are not glad to leave undisturbed in the dust of the
newspaper files some skeletons of their past&mdash;appalling errors of
denunciation or proclamation. Again and again, when his fellow
critics of another day wrote laughably of a then new tone poem of
Richard Strauss or pastel of Claude Debussy, Philip Hale delivered
a sane and still quotable judgment.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to modify by omissions Mr. Hale&rsquo;s
frank expressions of personal preferences among the composers.
This writer never spoke as a major prophet, but as one who might
be discussing a favorite subject over a demi-tasse. Anyone is privileged
to disagree, and those insisting upon their eternal verities are
referred to any one of a hundred books where the musical monuments
are enshrined in ringing platitudes of praise. When this
critic wrote, with the very opposite of solemnity, about Bach, or
Brahms, or Wagner, his ridicule was always directed against a certain
snobbish element in his public&mdash;a genus which sat at the feet
of these composers. &ldquo;There is, it is true, a gospel of Johannes
Brahms,&rdquo; he wrote as long ago as 1896, &ldquo;but Brahms, to use an old
New England phrase, is often a painful preacher of the word.&mdash;Brahms
is a safe play in Boston. Let me not be unthankful; let me
be duly appreciative of my educational opportunities in this town.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It is a joyful privilege to be the agent of bringing the treasure
of Philip Hale&rsquo;s musical knowledge and commentary within the
permanence and general accessibility of two covers. It was at first
hoped that the author could assist in the compilation, but, failing
in health, he was unable to give more than his whole-hearted assent
to the project. His death, November 30, 1934, came before the book
was far under way.</p>
<p>The material drawn upon is of vast proportions. From the
autumn of 1901 through the spring of 1933, Philip Hale contributed
programme notes for everything played by the Boston Symphony
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
Orchestra in its regular concerts&mdash;upward of a thousand works. As
music critic, Mr. Hale commented upon these and many more. He
wrote for the Boston <i>Home Journal</i> from 1889 to 1891; the Boston
<i>Journal</i> (like the other publication, long since extinct), from 1891
to 1903; and from then until his retirement in 1933 for the Boston
<i>Herald</i>. There were also the editorials on various musical topics
which he contributed anonymously to the <i>New Music Review</i> for
many years. Acknowledgment is due for the quotations made from
all of these publications; in particular the Boston Symphony
Orchestra Concert Bulletins, which have provided the bulk of this
book, and the Boston <i>Herald</i>, from which by far the larger number
of critical paragraphs are drawn. To these should be added the
innumerable writers to whom Mr. Hale himself has referred in the
course of his programme notes. The helpful advice of Mrs. Philip
Hale in the choice of the frontispiece is gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<p>The problem of selecting from the vast accumulation of Philip
Hale&rsquo;s writings became somewhat less formidable when a large
number of works now forgotten, and others still current but of
lesser importance, were eliminated. One hundred and twenty-five
works have been chosen, with the aim of including those most
often encountered upon symphony programmes. The works of
recent composers were necessarily limited to those which had been
played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and therefore described
in its programmes, up to April, 1933. They are still further limited
by the exigencies of space. The quoted reviews have been kept
clear, for the sake of continuity, of dates and sources; documentation
in the programme notes has been minimized. These notes are
given in the form in which they most recently appeared. Their
partial curtailment is justified by the readiness of their author to
adjust them to the space of the programme in hand. To have used
each note in its fullest form would have reduced the number of
works which the book could contain. As regards the newspaper
quotations, they are largely of recent years, and in any case represent
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
the writer&rsquo;s reconsidered opinion. A disproportion in the space
given to a certain composer or certain work may be set down to
the fact that in a few instances Mr. Hale did not happen at any
time to write one of his inimitable essays in miniature which could
be detached from the discussion of the occasion and the performance.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Some day an inquisitive musicologist will consider the part played
in the history of musical education and musical taste by that
seemingly indispensable adjunct of the symphonic concert room,
the Programme Note. When that time comes, the contributions
made by Philip Hale to the musical civilization of his time will
appear in their true proportions. For more than a generation, from
the beginning of the twentieth century to the fifth year of the
Great Depression, Hale provided programme notes for everything
played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in its regular concerts&mdash;&ldquo;upward
of a thousand works&rdquo;, as Mr. Burk informs us in his valuable
note to the present collection. The annual issue by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra of the bound volumes containing Philip
Hale&rsquo;s annotations was an event in the musical world of America
that exceeded in importance and interest the appearance of the
average new symphonic work upon the Orchestra&rsquo;s programmes.
A decade ago, in commenting upon the issue of one of those momentous
and liberal tomes (sometimes they included more than
two thousand pages), I remarked that it provided a musical education
in one volume. Those famous annotations&mdash;modestly indicated
on the title-page, in small and light-faced type, as &ldquo;historical
and descriptive notes by Philip Hale&rdquo;&mdash;constitute a library of
musical information the like of which is not to be found elsewhere
on this sufficiently book-congested sphere.</p>
<p>Though Hale was a New Englander by birth, he had not the
normal New England suspicion of entertainment as an educational
ingredient; and he did not scruple to amuse. He was almost indecently
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
readable. He never hesitated to lighten musical instruction
with diversion and with wit. He knew much besides music; and he
was able to peptonize for the reader his vast and curious erudition.
He could tell you about the maceration of Oriental women, and
what action is described by the word &ldquo;tutupomponeyer&rdquo;, and who
invented the first chess-playing automaton, and how locomotive
engines are classified, and what Pliny said concerning the bird
called penelope. He knew all about the various editions of the
singular <i>Commentaires sur les epistres d&rsquo;Ovide</i> by Claude Gaspar
Bachet, Sieur de Meziriac, in which the parentage of Ulysses is discussed.
He could tell you why the river Ebro bears that name; and
what Louis XIV ate for supper&mdash;which, you may like to be reminded,
often consisted of four plates of different soups, the whole
of a pheasant, a partridge, a heaped-up plate of salad, two huge
slices of ham, mutton stewed with garlic, and a plate of pastries
topped off with fruit and hard-boiled eggs. As for all the other
things that Hale knew, you must turn to his writings if you would
appreciate their range and number.</p>
<p>And all this fantastically varied learning&mdash;which not only seemed
boundless in extent, but which was also incredibly exact and circumstantial&mdash;adorned
a general culture that was nourishing and
humane, and a specifically musical culture which conceived no relevant
fact as inconsiderable, no anecdote unimportant, no human
aspect unrevealing. The average programme note is a deadly and
a stifling thing; but these amazing annotations, traversing all history
and the ceaseless tragi-comedy of life, assure us that a
programme note may sometimes, if an artist has contrived it, be
more rewarding than the music that occasioned it.</p>
<p>Philip Hale transformed the writing of programme notes from
an arid and depressing form of musical pedagogy into an exhilarating
variety of literary art. The formidable weight of learning
which he bore was employed with an ease and finesse, a lightness
of touch, a charm of manner, a wit and conciseness and flexibility,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
which belong among the achievements of distinguished letters. His
predecessor as annotator of the Boston Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s programmes,
the accomplished William Foster Apthorp, had prepared
the way for Hale&rsquo;s achievement. Apthorp&rsquo;s notes, written between
1892 and 1901, surpassed in brilliance and acumen anything that
had come out of Europe or America. But Philip Hale, by reason
of his exceptional width of intellectual range, and the well of
knowledge which he drew upon, and his insatiable, devouring,
delighted curiosity, established himself almost at once as the master
of an enlivened order of creative musical scholarship which was
a new thing under the tonal sun.</p>
<p>One might justly say of him, as critic, commentator, analyst,
what Sir George Grove said of Schubert&mdash;a saying that Hale himself
was fond of quoting: &ldquo;There never has been one like him, and
there never will be another.&rdquo;

<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">JOHANN SEBASTIAN</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BACH</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Eisenach on March 21, 1685; died at Leipsic on July 28, 1750)</p>
<p>No matter how well old music may be performed by chorus,
orchestra, virtuoso, many audiences are bored by it today.
There is one exception: the music of Bach. &ldquo;He is the forerunner,
the prophet that foresaw our epoch and our tastes.&rdquo; This speech
is often heard, as is the remark: &ldquo;There is not one ultra-modern
harmonic thought that is not to be found somewhere in Bach&rsquo;s
music.&rdquo; Bach is one of the great fetishes in music. The late John S.
Dwight really believed in the plenary inspiration of the indefatigable
weaver of counterpoint. No matter how formal, how dull a
page of music looked or sounded, Mr. Dwight was in ecstasy the
moment he was told the page was signed with Bach&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Mme Wanda Landowska (in <i>Musique ancienne</i>) says entertainingly:
&ldquo;The idea that the Cantor of Eisenach, though dedicating
his music to Frederick the Great and princes of his period, composed
it solely with a view to a Ch&acirc;telet audience is so consecrated
a commonplace that I hardly dare to dream of combating it.&rdquo; Von
B&uuml;low and others have declared that Bach&rsquo;s <i>Chromatic Fantasy</i> is
an anticipation of modern romanticism; but the composers hinted
at in this piece are more modern than Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann.
Frescobaldi, Buxtehude, Couperin, and the writers for the
lute are more modern because they are less known. And Bach not
only knew their works but followed them rather than the advanced
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
ideas of his own epoch; for Bach was a conservative rather than a
radical.</p>

<p>The six Brandenburg Concertos, completed on March 24, 1721, were
written in answer to the wish of a Prussian prince, Christian Ludwig,
Margraf of Brandenburg, the youngest son of the Great Elector by a
second wife. This prince was provost of the Cathedral at Halberstadt.
He was a bachelor, living now at Berlin and now on his estate at
Malchow. Fond of music, and not in an idle way, he was extravagant
in his tastes and mode of life, and often went beyond his income of
nearly fifty thousand thalers. In May, 1718, Prince Leopold of Anhalt-C&ouml;then,
at whose court Bach was <i>Kapellmeister</i>, journeyed to Carlsbad
to drink the waters. He took with him Bach and a quintet from his
orchestra; also his clavicembalo with three &ldquo;servants to care for it&rdquo;; he
was also thus attended when he visited Carlsbad in 1720. The Margraf
may have been at Carlsbad, and as he was very fond of music and had
his own orchestra, he undoubtedly attended Leopold&rsquo;s musical parties.
At any rate, he gave Bach a commission. It was on March 24, 1721, that
Bach&mdash;possibly someone at the Court&mdash;wrote a dedication in French:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>&ldquo;A son altesse royale, Monseigneur Cr&eacute;tien Louis, Margraf de Brandenbourg,
etc., etc., etc.</i></p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<i>Monseigneur</i>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years ago, when I had the honor of playing before your Royal
Highness, I experienced your condescending interest in the insignificant
musical talents with which heaven has gifted me, and understood your
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Royal Highness&rsquo;s gracious willingness to accept some pieces of my
composition. In accordance with that condescending command, I take
the liberty to present my most humble duty to your Royal Highness in
these Concerti for various instruments, begging your Highness not to
judge them by the standards of your own refined and delicate taste,
but to seek in them rather the expression of my profound respect and
obedience. In conclusion, Monseigneur, I most respectfully beg your
Royal Highness to continue your gracious favor toward me, and to be
assured that there is nothing I so much desire as to employ myself
more worthily in your service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the utmost fervor, Monseigneur, I subscribe myself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Royal Highness&rsquo;s most humble and most obedient servant,</p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Jean Sebastian Bach</span>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Coethen, 24 March, 1721.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These concertos&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Concerts avec plusieurs instruments</i>&rdquo;&mdash;were intended
as a gift for the Margraf&rsquo;s birthday in March. Nothing is known
about the reception in Berlin, nor is it positively known whether they
were ever played at the palace of the Margraf. &ldquo;The condition of the
autograph suggests that, like the parts of the &lsquo;Kyrie&rsquo; and &lsquo;Gloria&rsquo; of
the B minor Mass at Dresden, it was never performed by the recipient.&rdquo;
It was the Margraf&rsquo;s habit to catalogue his library. The name of Bach
was not found in the list, although the names of Vivaldi, Venturini,
Valentiri, Brescianello, and other writers of concertos were recorded.
After the death of the Margraf in 1734, Bach&rsquo;s score was put for sale
with other manuscripts in a &ldquo;job lot.&rdquo; The Brandenburg Concertos
came into the possession of J. P. Kirnberger. They were later owned
by the Princess Amalie, sister of Frederick the Great and a pupil of
Kirnberger. Their next and final home was the Royal Library, Berlin,
No. 78 in the Amalienbibliothek. They were edited by S. W. Dehn and
published by Peters, Leipsic, in 1850.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Little is known about these concertos. It is supposed that the seven
were formed by putting together various separate movements, or were
arrangements or transcriptions for the clavier. &ldquo;In all the concertos for
clavier, whether for one instrument or many, there are passages for the
solo instrument unaccompanied which anticipate the procedure of
modern concertos, with considerable use of <i>arpeggios</i>, and even occasional
<i>cadenza</i> passages. Bach follows the Italian types in the general
scheme and easy style of the quick movements, and they are rather
homophonic in feeling, with the exception of the last movement of the
double concerto in C major, which is a fugue of the most vivacious
description.... Bach clearly enjoyed writing in the concerto form and
found it congenial. It would be even natural to infer that he found
opportunities for performing the works, as in many cases the same
concertos appear in versions both for violin and clavier.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Parry also says: &ldquo;When Bach writes slow movements for the clavier,
he makes them serve as phases of contrast to the quick movements, in
which some rather abstract melody is discussed with a certain aloofness
of manner, or treated with elaborate ornamentation, such as was more
suited to the instrument than passages of sustained melody pure and
simple. The alternative presented in the admirable concerto for the
clavier in D minor is to give a <i>Siciliano</i> in place of the central slow
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
movement, a course which provides a type of melody well adapted to
the limited sustaining power of the harpsichord.... The finest of
them [the concertos] is that in D minor, above mentioned, which from
its style would appear to have been written at C&ouml;then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is supposed that there was use of the general bass in these concertos.
A second clavier was usually employed; but there is reason to
believe that a portable organ, or lutes, theorbos, and the like were also
used in accompaniment. Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote in his <i>J. S. Bach</i>
(Leipsic, 1905): &ldquo;The seven concertos for clavier are in effect, and with
one exception only, transcriptions made at Leipsic after 1730 at a time
when Bach saw himself obliged to write concertos for the performances
of the Telemann Society, which he began to conduct in 1729, and for
the little family concerts at his own home. These transcriptions are of
unequal worth. Some were made carefully and with art, while others
betray impatience in the accomplishment of an uninteresting task. Only
one of the pianoforte concertos is not derived from a violin concerto.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">THE ORCHESTRAL SUITES</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dt>No. 1. Suite in C (for two oboes, and bassoon, with strings)</dt>
<dt>No. 2. Suite in B minor (for flute with strings)</dt>
<dt>No. 3. Suite in D (for two oboes, three trumpets, and drums, with strings)</dt>
<dt>No. 4. Suite in D (for three oboes, bassoon, three trumpets, and drums, with strings)</dt></dl>
<p>The term &ldquo;suite&rdquo; was not given by Bach to the four compositions
that now are so named&mdash;the suites in C major, B minor, and two in
D major. He used the word &ldquo;<i>ouverture.</i>&rdquo; The original parts of these
overtures were handed over in 1854 by the Singakademie of Berlin to
the Royal (now Stadt) Library of that city.</p>
<p>Bach probably composed the four suites during his stay at C&ouml;then
(1717-23), as <i>Kapellmeister</i> to Prince Leopold of Anhalt-C&ouml;then. The
prince was then nearly twenty-four years old, an amiable, well-educated
young man, who had traveled and was fond of books and
pictures. He played the violin, the viol da gamba, and the harpsichord.
Furthermore, he had an agreeable bass voice and was more than
an ordinary singer. Bach said of him, &ldquo;He loved music, he was well
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
acquainted with it, he understood it.&rdquo; The music at the Court was
chiefly chamber music, and here Bach passed happy years.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Leopold&rsquo;s puritanical father there was no Court
orchestra, but in 1707 Gisela, Leopold&rsquo;s wife, set up to please her
husband an establishment of three musicians. When Leopold returned
from his grand tour he expanded the orchestra. In 1714 he appointed
Augustinus Reinhard Stricker <i>Kapellmeister</i>, and Stricker&rsquo;s wife Catherine
soprano and lutanist. In 1716 the orchestra numbered eighteen
players who, &ldquo;with some omissions and additions,&rdquo; constituted its
membership under Bach. Stricker and his wife retired in August, 1717.
Leopold offered the post of <i>Kapellmeister</i> to Bach, &ldquo;who was known
to him since his sister&rsquo;s wedding at Nienburg in the previous year.&rdquo;
This orchestra, reinforced by visiting players, probably played the Brandenburg
music before it was performed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Why debate whether the music of this First symphony is wholly
Mozartian; whether there are traces of the &ldquo;greater&rdquo; Beethoven?
Let the music be taken for what it is, music of the end of the
eighteenth century. At the same time let us recall the fact that
when this symphony was played in Paris a hundred years ago,
two or three critics protested against the &ldquo;astonishing success&rdquo; of
Beethoven&rsquo;s works as &ldquo;a danger to musical art.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is believed,&rdquo;
said one, &ldquo;that a prodigal use of the most barbaric dissonances and
a noisy use of all the orchestral instruments will make an effect.
Alas, the ear is only stabbed; there is no appeal to the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of pages of mere routine, the music still has a certain
freshness and a quaint beauty. The symphony will always remain a
charming work with trivial passages, not to be compared as a
whole with the three great symphonies of Mozart or the latter
symphonies of Haydn.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The symphony in C major, No. 1, probably originated in 1800, was
sketched at an earlier period, and elaborated in 1799.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The first performance was at a concert given by Beethoven at the
National Court Theater, &ldquo;next the Burg,&rdquo; Vienna, April 2, 1800.</p>
<p>The concert began at 6:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> The prices of admission were not
raised. It was the first concert given in Vienna by Beethoven for his
own benefit. A correspondent of the <i>Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</i>
(October 15, 1800) gave curious information concerning the performance.
&ldquo;At the end a symphony composed by him was performed. It
contains much art, and the ideas are abundant and original, but the
wind instruments are used far too much, so that the music is more for
a band of wind instruments than an orchestra.&rdquo; The performance
suffered on account of the conductor, Paul Wranitzky. The orchestra
men disliked him and took no pains under his direction. Furthermore,
they thought Beethoven&rsquo;s music too difficult. &ldquo;In the second movement
of the symphony they took the matter so easily that there was no
spirit, in spite of the conductor, especially in the performance of the
wind instruments.... What marked effect, then, can even the most
excellent compositions make?&rdquo; The parts were published in 1801 and
dedicated to Baron von Swieten.</p>
<p>Berlioz<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> wrote concerning it as follows: &ldquo;This work is wholly different
in form, melodic style, harmonic sobriety, and instrumentation
from the compositions of Beethoven that follow it. When the composer
wrote it, he was evidently under the sway of Mozartian ideas. These
he sometimes enlarged, but he has imitated them ingeniously everywhere.
Especially in the first two movements do we find springing up
occasionally certain rhythms used by the composer of <i>Don Giovanni</i>,
but these occasions are rare and far less striking. The first <i>allegro</i> has
for a theme a phrase of six measures, which is not distinguished in
itself but becomes interesting through the artistic treatment. An episodic
melody follows, but it has little distinction of style. By means of a
half cadence, repeated three or four times, we come to a figure in
imitation for wind instruments; and we are the more surprised to find
it here, because it had been so often employed in several overtures to
French operas. The <i>andante</i> contains an accompaniment of drums,
<i>piano</i>, which appears today rather ordinary, yet we recognize in it a
hint at striking effects produced later by Beethoven with the aid of
this instrument, which is seldom or badly employed as a rule by his
predecessors. This movement is full of charm; the theme is graceful
and lends itself easily to fugued development, by means of which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
composer has succeeded in being ingenious and piquant. The <i>scherzo</i>
is the first-born of the family of charming <i>badinages</i> or <i>scherzi</i>, of
which Beethoven invented the form and determined the pace; which
he substituted in nearly all of his instrumental works for the minuet of
Mozart and Haydn with a pace doubly less rapid and with a wholly
different character. This <i>scherzo</i> is of exquisite freshness, lightness and
grace. It is the one truly original thing in this symphony in which the
poetic idea, so great and rich in the majority of his succeeding works,
is wholly wanting. It is music admirably made, clear, alert, but slightly
accentuated, cold, and sometimes mean and shabby, as in the final
<i>rondo</i>, which is musically childish. In a word, this is not Beethoven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This judgment of Berlioz has been vigorously combated by all
fetishists that believe in the plenary inspiration of a great composer.
Thus Michel Brenet<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> (1882), usually discriminative, found that the
introduction begins in a highly original manner. Marx took the trouble
to refute the statement of Ulibichev,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> that the first movement was an
imitation of the beginning of Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Jupiter</i>&rdquo; symphony&mdash;a futile
task. We find Dr. Prof. H. Reimann<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> in 1899 stoutly maintaining the
originality of many pages of this symphony. Thus in the introduction
the first chord with its resolution is a &ldquo;genuine innovation by Beethoven.&rdquo;
He admits that the chief theme of the <i>allegro con brio</i> with its
subsidiary theme and jubilant sequel recalls irresistibly Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Jupiter</i>&rdquo;;
&ldquo;but the passage <i>pianissimo</i> by the close in G major, in which
the basses use the subsidiary theme, and in which the oboe introduces
a song, is new and surprising, and the manner in which by a crescendo
the closing section of the first chapter is developed is wholly Beethovenish&rdquo;!
He is also lost in admiration at the thought of the development
itself. He finds the true Beethoven in more than one page of the
<i>andante</i>. The trio of the <i>scherzo</i> is an example of Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;tone-painting.&rdquo;
The introduction of the <i>finale</i> is &ldquo;wholly original, although
one may often find echoes of Haydn and Mozart in what follows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colombani combated the idea that the symphony is a weak imitation
of symphonies by Haydn and Mozart. Ulibichev wrote that Beethoven,
in order to reveal himself, waited for the minuet. &ldquo;The rhythmic movement
is changed into that of a <i>scherzo</i>, after the manner instituted by
the composer in his first sonatas.&rdquo; When the symphony was first performed
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
at Leipsic, a critic described it as a &ldquo;confused explosion of the
outrageous effrontery of a young man.&rdquo; At Vienna in 1810, the work
was described as &ldquo;more amiable&rdquo; than the second symphony.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 2, IN D MAJOR, OP. 36</span></h2>

<p>The symphony is an answer to those who insist that the inner
emotions of a composer must find a vent in the music composed
at the time. Never was Beethoven more wretched physically and
mentally than when he wrote this symphony, music that breathes
forth serenity, beauty, gayety, and courage.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>In 1801 Beethoven&rsquo;s deafness, which had begun with a roaring in
his ears, grew on him. He suffered also from frightful colic. He consulted
physician after physician; tried oil of almonds, cold baths and
hot baths, pills and herbs and blisters; he was curious about galvanic
remedies, and in his distress he wrote: &ldquo;I shall as far as possible defy
my fate, although there must be moments when I shall be the most
miserable of God&rsquo;s creatures.... I will grapple with fate; it shall
never pull me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Schmidt sent him in 1802 to the little village of Heiligenstadt,
where, as the story goes, the Emperor Protus planted the first vines of
Noricum. There was a spring of mineral water&mdash;a spring of marvelous
virtues&mdash;which had been blessed by St. Severinus, who died in the
village and gave the name by which it is known today. Beethoven&rsquo;s
house was on a hill outside the village, isolated, with a view of the
Danube valley. Here he lived for several months like a hermit. He
saw only his physician and Ferdinand Ries, his pupil, who visited him
occasionally.</p>
<p>Nature and loneliness did not console Beethoven. He had been in
dismal mood since the performance of the First symphony (April,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
1800). The powers of darkness, &ldquo;<i>finstere M&auml;chte</i>,&rdquo; to quote Wasielewski&rsquo;s
phrase, had begun to torment him. He had already felt the first
attacks of deafness. It is possible that the first symptoms were in
1796, when, as a story goes, returning overheated from a walk,
he plunged his head into cold water. &ldquo;It would not be safe to
say that the smallpox, which in his childhood left marks on his
face, was a remote cause of his deafness.&rdquo; In 1800-01 Beethoven wrote
about his deafness and intestinal troubles to Dr. Wegeler, and to the
clergyman, Carl Amenda, in Kurland. It was at the beginning of
October, 1802, that Beethoven, at Heiligenstadt, almost ready to put
an end to his life, wrote a letter to his brothers, the document known as
&ldquo;Beethoven&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; which drips yew-like melancholy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beethoven was still passionately in love with Giulietta
Guicciardi, of whom he wrote to Wegeler, November 16, 1801: &ldquo;You
can hardly believe what a sad and lonely life I have passed for two
years. My poor hearing haunted me as a specter, and I shunned men.
It was necessary for me to appear misanthropic, and I am not this at
all. This change is the work of a charming child who loves me and is
loved by me. After two years I have again had some moments of
pleasure, and for the first time I feel that marriage could make me
happy. Unfortunately, she is not of my rank in life, and now I certainly
cannot marry.&rdquo; Beethoven, however, asked for her hand. One of her
parents looked favorably on the match. The other, probably the father,
the Count Guicciardi, refused to give his daughter to a man without
rank, without fortune, and without a position of any kind. Giulietta
became the Countess Gallenberg. Beethoven told Schindler that after
her marriage she sought him out in Vienna, and she wept, but that he
despised her.</p>
<p>Yet during the sad period of the winter of 1802-03, Beethoven composed
the Second symphony, a joyous, &ldquo;a heroic lie,&rdquo; to borrow the
descriptive phrase of Camille Bellaigue.</p>
<p>The first performance of the Second symphony was at the Theater
an der Wien, April 5, 1803. The symphony was performed at Leipsic,
April 29, 1804, and Spazier characterized it as &ldquo;a gross monster, a
pierced dragon which will not die, and even in losing its blood (in the
<i>finale</i>), wild with rage, still deals vain but furious blows with his tail,
stiffened by the last agony.&rdquo; Spazier, who died early in 1805, was
described by his contemporaries as a learned and well-grounded
musician and a man of sound judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>A Leipsic critic found that the symphony would gain if certain passages
were abbreviated and certain modulations were sacrificed. Another
declared that it was too long; that there was an exaggerated use of the
wind instruments; that the <i>finale</i> was bizarre, harsh, savage. Yet he
added that there was such fire, such richness of new ideas, such an
absolutely original disposition of these ideas, that the work would live;
&ldquo;and it will always be heard with renewed pleasure when a thousand
things that are today in fashion will have been long buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sketch of Berlioz may here serve as an analysis: &ldquo;In this
symphony everything is noble, energetic, proud. The introduction
(<i>largo</i>) is a masterpiece. The most beautiful effects follow one another
without confusion and always in an unexpected manner. The song is
of a touching solemnity, and it at once commands respect and puts
the hearer in an emotional mood. The rhythm is already bolder, the
instrumentation is richer, more sonorous, more varied. An <i>allegro con
brio</i> of enchanting dash is joined to this admirable <i>adagio</i>. The <i>gruppetto</i>
which is found in the first measure of the theme, given at first to
the violas and violoncellos in unison, is taken up again in an isolated
form, to establish either progressions in a <i>crescendo</i> or imitative passages
between wind instruments and the strings. All these forms have
a new and animated physiognomy. A melody enters, the first section
of which is played by clarinets, horns, and bassoons. It is completed
<i>en tutti</i> by the rest of the orchestra, and the manly energy is enhanced
by the happy choice of accompanying chords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>andante</i> [<i>larghetto</i>] is not treated after the manner of that
of the First symphony: it is not composed of a theme worked out in
canonic imitations, but it is a pure and frank song, which at first is
sung simply by the strings, and then embroidered with a rare elegance
by means of light and fluent figures whose character is never far
removed from the sentiment of tenderness which forms the distinctive
character of the principal idea. It is a ravishing picture of innocent
pleasure which is scarcely shadowed by a few melancholy accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>scherzo</i> is as frankly gay in its fantastic capriciousness as the
<i>andante</i> has been wholly and serenely happy; for this symphony is
smiling throughout; the warlike bursts of the first <i>allegro</i> are wholly
free from violence; there is only the youthful ardor of a noble heart in
which the most beautiful illusions of life are preserved untainted. The
composer still believes in immortal glory, in love, in devotion. What
abandon in his gayety! What wit! What sallies! Hearing these various
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
instruments disputing over fragments of a theme which no one of them
plays in its complete form, hearing each fragment thus colored with a
thousand nuances as it passes from one to the other, it is as though
you were watching the fairy sports of Oberon&rsquo;s graceful spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>finale</i> is of like nature. It is a second <i>scherzo</i> in two time, and
its playfulness has perhaps something still more delicate, more piquant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is interesting to note the difference in the expression of heroism
between this symphony and Strauss&rsquo;s <i>Heldenleben</i>. To be sure,
Beethoven had Bonaparte at first in mind, while in <i>Heldenleben</i>
the hero is&mdash;Richard Strauss, defying his enemies, rejoicing vaingloriously
in his immortality as a composer. It is not necessary to
accept the theories of Beethoven&rsquo;s commentators. The excellent
Nietzel finds that, in the second theme of the first movement, &ldquo;the
hero, having for the first time exerted his force, turns about to
look at the path he has trod.&rdquo; Wagner sees Man, not merely a
triumphant soldier, the hero. Schindler believes the symphony to
be the celebration of the French Revolution. And so on and so on.
It is enough that the structure and the spirit of the symphony are
heroic, that there is the grand gesture, that even in the Funeral
March there is no whine of pessimism, no luxury of woe. It is a
heroic lamentation over heroes slain in defence of freedom, a
lamentation in which there is exultation, even in grief.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>At Nussdorf in the summer of 1817, Beethoven, who had then composed
eight symphonies, and the poet Christian Kuffner were having a
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
fish dinner at the Tavern Zur Rose. Kuffner asked him which of his
symphonies was his favorite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! Eh!&rdquo; said Beethoven. &ldquo;The <i>Eroica</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have guessed the C minor,&rdquo; said Kuffner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the <i>Eroica</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Anton Schindler wrote in his life of Beethoven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;First in the fall of 1802 was his [Beethoven&rsquo;s] mental condition so
much bettered that he could take hold afresh of his long-formulated
plan and make some progress: to pay homage with a great instrumental
work to the hero of the time, Napoleon. Yet not until 1803 did
he set himself seriously to this gigantic work, which we now know
under the title of <i>Sinfonia Eroica</i>: on account of many interruptions
it was not finished until the following year.... The first idea of this
symphony is said to have come from General Bernadotte, who was
then French Ambassador at Vienna and highly treasured Beethoven.
I heard this from many friends of Beethoven. Count Moritz Lichnowsky,
who was often with Beethoven in the company of Bernadotte, ...
told me the same story.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Schindler also wrote, with reference to the
year 1823: &ldquo;The correspondence of the King of Sweden led Beethoven&rsquo;s
memory back to the time when the King, then General Bernadotte,
Ambassador of the French Republic, was at Vienna, and Beethoven
had a lively recollection of the fact that Bernadotte indeed first awakened
in him the idea of the <i>Sinfonia Eroica</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements are direct. Unfortunately, Schindler, in the third
edition of his book, mentioned Beethoven as a visitor at the house of
Bernadotte in 1798, repeated the statement that Bernadotte inspired the
idea of the symphony, and added: &ldquo;Not long afterward the idea
blossomed into a deed&rdquo;; he also laid stress on the fact that Beethoven
was a stanch republican and cited, in support of his admiration of
Napoleon, passages from Beethoven&rsquo;s own copy of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s
translation of Plato.</p>
<p>Thayer admits that the thought of Napoleon may have influenced
the form and the contents of the symphony; that the composer may
have based a system of politics on Plato; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;Bernadotte
had been long absent from Vienna before the Consular form of government
was adopted at Paris, and before Schleiermacher&rsquo;s Plato was
published in Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The symphony was composed in 1803-04. The story is that the title
page of the manuscript bore the word &ldquo;Buonaparte,&rdquo; and at the
bottom of the page &ldquo;Luigi van Beethoven&rdquo;; and &ldquo;not a word more,&rdquo;
said Ries, who saw the manuscript. &ldquo;I was the first,&rdquo; also said Ries,
&ldquo;to bring him the news that Bonaparte had had himself declared
emperor, whereat he broke out angrily: &lsquo;Then he&rsquo;s nothing but an
ordinary man. Now he&rsquo;ll trample on all the rights of men to serve his
own ambition; he will put himself higher than all others and turn out
a tyrant!&rsquo;&rdquo; There is also the story that when the death of Napoleon
was announced, Beethoven exclaimed: &ldquo;Did I not foresee the catastrophe
when I wrote the Funeral March in the <i>Eroica</i>?&rdquo; Vincent d&rsquo;Indy
argues against Schindler&rsquo;s theory that Beethoven wished to celebrate
the French Revolution <i>en bloc</i>. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;&eacute;tait l&rsquo;homme de Brumaire</i>&rdquo; that
Beethoven honored by his dedication. The autograph score, sold at
auction in Vienna in 1827 for three florins, ten kreutzers, shows the
erasure of two words under &ldquo;<i>Sinfonia grande</i>&rdquo; on the title page: one
is plainly &ldquo;Bonaparte&rdquo;; under his own name, Beethoven wrote, in large
characters, &ldquo;Written on Bonaparte.&rdquo; Paul Bekker, arguing that the
<i>Eroica</i> is not the portrait of any one hero, but that the symphony
represents his concept of human heroism, believes that the first movement
is the only one of direct connection with Napoleon: &ldquo;The hero&rsquo;s
deeds have resulted in victory, the restless will has achieved fulfilment.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>There can be nothing in the statements that have come down from
Czerny, Dr. Bartolini, and others: the first <i>Allegro</i> describes a sea fight;
the Funeral March is in memory of Nelson or General Abercrombie,
etc. There can be no doubt that Napoleon, the young conqueror, the
Consul, the enemy of kings, worked a spell over Beethoven, as over
Berlioz, Hazlitt, Victor Hugo; for, according to W. E. Henley&rsquo;s paradox,
although, as despot, Napoleon had &ldquo;no love for new ideas and no
tolerance for intellectual independence,&rdquo; yet he was &ldquo;the great First
Cause of Romanticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first performance of the symphony was at a private concert at
Prince Lobkowitz&rsquo;s in December, 1804. The composer conducted, and
in the second half of the first <i>Allegro</i> he brought the orchestra to grief,
so that a fresh start was made. The first performance in public was at a
concert given by Clement at the Theater an der Wien, April 7, 1805.
The symphony was announced as &ldquo;A new grand Symphony in D sharp
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
by Herr Ludwig van Beethoven, dedicated to his Excellence Prince
von Lobkowitz.&rdquo; Beethoven conducted. Czerny remembered that someone
shouted from the gallery: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give another kreutzer if they would
stop.&rdquo; Beethoven&rsquo;s friends declared the work a masterpiece. Some said it
would gain if it were shortened, if there were more &ldquo;light, clearness,
and unity.&rdquo; Others found it a mixture of the good, the grotesque, the
tiresome.</p>
<p>The symphony was published in October, 1806. The title in Italian
stated that it was to celebrate the memory of a great man. And there
was this note: &ldquo;Since this symphony is longer than an ordinary symphony,
it should be performed at the beginning rather than at the end
of a concert, either after an overture or an aria, or after a concerto. If
it be performed too late, there is the danger that it will not produce on
the audience, whose attention will be already wearied by preceding
pieces, the effect which the composer purposed in his own mind to
attain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The theme of the first movement is note for note the same as that
of the first measures of the Intrade written by Mozart in 1768, at
Vienna, for his one-act operetta, <i>Bastien et Bastienne</i>, performed that
year in a Viennese garden house. Beethoven&rsquo;s theme is finished by the
violins and developed at length. There is a subsidiary theme, which
begins with a series of detached phrases distributed among wood-wind
instruments and then the violins. The second theme, of a plaintive
character, is given out alternately by wood-wind and strings. The development
is most elaborate, full of striking contrasts, rich in new ideas.
The passage in which the horn enters with the first two measures of
the first theme in the tonic chord of the key, while the violins keep up
a tremolo on A flat and B flat, has given rise to many anecdotes and
provoked fierce discussion. The <i>coda</i> is of unusual length.</p>
<p>The Funeral March, <i>Adagio assai</i>, C minor, 2-4, begins, <i>pianissimo
e sotto voce</i>, with the theme in the first violins, accompanied by simple
chords in the other strings. The theme is repeated by the oboe, accompanied
by wood-wind instruments and strings; the strings give the
second portion of the theme. A development by full orchestra follows.
The second theme is in C major. Phrases are given out by various
wood-wind instruments in alternation, accompanied by triplet <i>arpeggios</i>
in the strings. This theme, too, is developed; and there is a return to
the first theme in C minor in the strings. There is fugal development
at length of a figure that is not closely connected with either of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
two themes. The first theme reappears for a moment, but strings and
brass enter <i>fortissimo</i> in A flat major. This episode is followed by
another; and at last the first theme returns in fragmentary form in the
first violins, accompanied by a <i>pizzicato</i> bass and chords in oboes and
horns.</p>
<p>M. d&rsquo;Indy,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> discussing the patriotism of Beethoven as shown in his
music, calls attention to the <i>militarisme</i>, the adaptation of a warlike
rhythm to melody, that characterizes this march.</p>
<p><i>Scherzo</i>: <i>allegro vivace</i>, E flat major, 3-4. Strings are <i>pianissimo</i> and
<i>staccato</i>, and oboe and first violins play a gay theme which Marx says
is taken from an old Austrian folk song. This melody is the basic
material of the <i>scherzo</i>. The trio in E flat major includes hunting calls
by the horns, which are interrupted by passages in wood-wind instruments
or strings.</p>
<p><i>Finale</i>: <i>allegro molto</i>, E flat major, 2-4. A theme, or, rather, a double
theme, with variations. Beethoven was fond of this theme, for he had
used it in the <i>finale</i> of his ballet, <i>Die Gesch&ouml;pfe des Prometheus</i>, in
the Variations for pianoforte, Op. 35, and in a country dance. After a
few measures of introduction, the bass to the melody which is to come
is given out, as though it were an independent theme. The first two
variations in the strings are contrapuntal. In the third the tuneful
second theme is in the wood-wind against runs in the first violins. The
fourth is a long fugal development of the first theme against a counter
subject found in the first variation. Variations in G minor follow, and
the second theme is heard in C major. There is a new fugal development
of the inverted first theme. The tempo changes to <i>poco andante</i>,
wood-wind instruments play an expressive version of the second theme,
which is developed to a <i>coda</i> for full orchestra, and the symphony ends
with a joyful glorification of the theme.</p>
<p>First performances: London, 1814. Paris (at a rehearsal in 1815 everybody
laughed after the first and second movement; this happened at
another attempt some years later), Conservatory Orchestra, 1828. St.
Petersburg, 1834. Rome, 1860. Madrid, 1878.</p>

<p>Of the nine symphonies of Beethoven the Fourth and Sixth are
the least impressive. The First is historically interesting, and its
<i>finale</i> is delightfully gay. The Second is also interesting as showing
the development of Beethoven&rsquo;s musical mind. After the <i>Eroica</i>,
the Fourth seems a droop in the flight of imagination. Yet there
are noble and strange things in this symphony, things that only
Beethoven could have written: the introduction, the mysterious
measures with the <i>crescendo</i> that majestically re&euml;stablishes the chief
tonality in the first movement; the superb <i>adagio</i>.</p>
<p class="tb">The old theory that the Fourth was inspired by Beethoven&rsquo;s love
for Therese Brunswick; that he was betrothed to her, which made
happiness the keynote to the music, has been disproved, if ever it
was accepted by students of Beethoven&rsquo;s life. As a matter of fact,
nothing is known about the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of the music. A German commentator
has recently spoken of &ldquo;indecisiveness of mood&rdquo; as &ldquo;part
of the imaginative scheme of the whole work&rdquo;; he even sees in the
<i>adagio</i> &ldquo;the stimulus of some tense emotion&rdquo; such as inspired the
love letter, whether aroused by the &ldquo;Immortal&rdquo; or some other beloved.
Is it not enough to hear the serene, nobly emotional <i>adagio</i>
without vain speculation as to why Beethoven was so deeply
moved? Nor is it necessary to see Berlioz&rsquo;s Archangel Michael,
who, by the way, was the warlike leader of the angelic hosts, sighing
and overcome by melancholy, as &ldquo;he contemplated the worlds
from the threshold of the empyrean.&rdquo; One might ask why should
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
Michael grow melancholy at the glorious sight? Nor can Beethoven&rsquo;s
<i>adagio</i> be justly characterized as melancholy.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The composition of Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony No. 5 in C minor was
interrupted by work on the Symphony in B flat major, No. 4, a symphony
of a very different character. The symphony was probably
planned and composed in the summer of 1806. &ldquo;Having been played
in March, 1807, at one of the two subscription concerts at Lobkowitz&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
Thayer is justified in adding solemnly that &ldquo;it must have been finished
at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the performance of the <i>Eroica</i>, Beethoven also worked on his
opera, <i>Fidelio</i>. The French army entered Vienna November 13, 1805;
on the 15th, Napoleon sent to the Viennese a proclamation dated at
Sch&ouml;nbrunn, and on November 20, 1805, <i>Fidelio</i> was performed for
the first time, before an audience largely composed of French officers.
There were three performances, and the opera was withdrawn until
March 29, 1806, when it was reduced from three acts to two. The
opera was again coldly received; there were two performances; and
there was no revival in Vienna until 1814.</p>
<p>Beethoven, disturbed by the disaster which attended the first performances
of his <i>Fidelio</i> in Vienna, during the French invasion, went
in 1806 to Hungary to visit his friend, Count Brunswick. He visited the
Prince Lichnowsky at Castle Gr&auml;tz, which was near Troppau in Silesia.
It has been said that at Martonv&aacute;s&aacute;r, visiting the Brunswicks, he found
that he loved Therese and that his love was returned. Some, therefore,
account for the postponement of the Fifth symphony, begun before the
Fourth, &ldquo;by the fact that in May, 1806, Beethoven became engaged to
the Countess Therese.... The B flat symphony has been mentioned
as &lsquo;the most tenderly classical&rsquo; of all works of its kind; its keynote is
&lsquo;happiness&rsquo;&mdash;a contentment which could have come to the master only
through such an incident as the one above set forth&mdash;his betrothal.&rdquo; We
do not see the force of this reasoning.</p>
<p>It is better to say with Thayer that nothing is known about the origin
of the Fourth beyond the inscription put by the composer on the manuscript
which belongs to the Mendelssohn family: &ldquo;<i>Sinfonia 4<sup>ta</sup> 1806.
L. v. Bthvn.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This we do know: that, while Beethoven was visiting Prince Lichnowsky
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
at the latter&rsquo;s Castle Gr&auml;tz, the two called on Franz, Count
Oppersdorff, who had a castle near Grossglogau. This count, born in
1778, rich and high-born, was fond of music; he had at this castle a
well-drilled orchestra, which then played Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony in
D major in the presence of the composer. In June, 1807, he commissioned
Beethoven to compose a symphony, paid him two hundred
florins in advance and one hundred and fifty florins more in 1808.
Beethoven accepted the offer, and purposed to give the Symphony in
C minor to the Count; but he changed his mind, and in November,
1808, the Count received, not the symphony, but a letter of apology, in
which Beethoven said that he had been obliged to sell the symphony
which he had composed for him, and also another&mdash;these were probably
the Fifth and the Sixth&mdash;but that the Count would receive soon
the one intended for him. The Fifth and Sixth were dedicated to
Prince Lobkowitz and Count Rasoumowsky. Oppersdorff at last received
the Fourth symphony, dedicated to him, a symphony that was
begun before he gave the commission; he received it after it had been
performed. He was naturally offended, especially as the Fourth symphony
at first met with little favor. He did not give Beethoven another
commission, nor did he meet him again, although Beethoven visited
again the Castle Gr&auml;tz in 1811. The Count died January 21, 1818.</p>
<p>The Fourth symphony was performed for the first time at one
of two concerts given in Vienna about the 15th of March, 1807, at
Prince Lobkowitz&rsquo;s. The concert was for the benefit of the composer.
The <i>Journal des Luxus und der Moden</i> published this review early
in April of that year:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beethoven gave in the dwelling house of Prince L. two concerts in
which only his own compositions were performed: the first four
symphonies, an overture to the tragedy <i>Coriolanus</i>, a pianoforte concerto,
and some arias from <i>Fidelio</i>. Wealth of ideas, bold originality,
and fullness of strength, the peculiar characteristics of Beethoven&rsquo;s
Muse, were here plainly in evidence. Yet many took exception to the
neglect of noble simplicity, to the excessive amassing thoughts, which
on account of their number are not always sufficiently blended and
elaborated, and therefore often produce the effect of uncut diamonds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this &ldquo;Prince L.&rdquo; Lobkowitz or Lichnowsky? Thayer decided in
favor of the former.</p>
<p>Berlioz writes of this symphony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Beethoven abandons wholly the ode and the elegy&mdash;a reference
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
to the <i>Eroica</i> symphony&mdash;to return to the less lofty and somber
but perhaps no less difficult style of the Second symphony. The character
of this score is generally lively, nimble, joyous, or of a heavenly
sweetness. If we except the meditative <i>adagio</i>, which serves as an
introduction, the first movement is almost entirely given up to joyfulness.
The motive in detached notes, with which the <i>allegro</i> begins, is
only a canvas, on which the composer spreads other and more substantial
melodies, which thus render the apparently chief idea of the
beginning an accessory. This artifice, although it is fertile in curious
and interesting results, has already been employed by Mozart and
Haydn with equal success. But we find in the second section of this
same <i>allegro</i> an idea that is truly new, the first measures of which captivate
the attention; this idea, after leading the hearer&rsquo;s mind through
mysterious developments, astonishes it by its unexpected ending....
This astonishing <i>crescendo</i> is one of the most skillfully contrived things
we know of in music: you will hardly find its equal except in that
which ends the famous <i>scherzo</i> of the Symphony in C minor. And this
latter, in spite of its immense effectiveness, is conceived on a less vast
scale, for it sets out from <i>piano</i> to arrive at the final explosion without
departing from the principal key, while the one whose march we
have just described starts from <i>mezzo-forte</i>, is lost for a moment in a
<i>pianissimo</i> beneath which are harmonies with vague and undecided
coloring, then reappears with chords of a more determined tonality,
and bursts out only at the moment when the cloud that veiled this
modulation is completely dissipated. You might compare it to a river
whose calm waters suddenly disappear and only leave the subterranean
bed to plunge with a roar in a foaming waterfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the <i>adagio</i>&mdash;it escapes analysis. It is so pure in form, the
melodic expression is so angelic and of such irresistible tenderness, that
the prodigious art of the workmanship disappears completely. You are
seized, from the first measure, by an emotion which at the end becomes
overwhelming in its intensity; and it is only in the works of one of
these giants of poetry that we can find a point of comparison with this
sublime page of the giant of music. Nothing, indeed, more resembles
the impression produced by this <i>adagio</i> than that which we experience
when we read the touching episode of Francesca da Rimini in the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>, the recital of which Virgil cannot hear &lsquo;without
weeping in sobs,&rsquo; and which, at the last verse, makes Dante &lsquo;fall, as
falls a dead body.&rsquo; This movement seems to have been sighed by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
archangel Michael, one day when, overcome by melancholy, he contemplated
the worlds from the threshold of the empyrean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>scherzo</i> consists almost wholly of phrases in binary rhythm
forced to enter into combinations of 3-4 time.... The melody of
the trio, given to wind instruments, is of a delicious freshness; the pace
is a little slower than that of the rest of the <i>scherzo</i>, and its simplicity
stands out in still greater elegance from the opposition of the little
phrases which the violins throw across the wind instruments, like so
many teasing but charming allurements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>finale</i>, gay and lively, returns to ordinary rhythmic forms; it
consists of a jingling of sparkling notes, interrupted, however, by some
hoarse and savage chords, in which are shown the angry outbursts
which we have already had occasion to notice in the composer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the Fifth symphony, what words can be said of its composer
more fitting than those of De Quincey&rsquo;s apostrophe to
Shakespeare; &ldquo;O mighty poet! Thy works are not those of other
men, simply and merely great works of art, but are also like the
phenomena of nature, like the sun and the sea, the stars and the
flowers, the frost and the dew, hailstorm and thunder, which are
to be studied with entire submission of our own faculties, and in
the perfect faith that in them there can be no too much or too little,
nothing useless or inert, but that the farther we press in our discoveries,
the more we shall see proofs of design and self-supporting
arrangement where the careless eye had nothing but accident!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In all modern music there is no page more thrilling than that
of the mysterious, unearthly transition from the <i>scherzo</i> to the
<i>finale</i>, and the preceding pages are the triumph of absolute music
over that which needs a programme or is the translation of something
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
into music. Here is music that was not suggested, but it suggests
that which can only be imagined, not spoken, not painted,
not written in lofty rhyme or passionate prose.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Beethoven sketched motives of the <i>Allegro</i>, <i>Andante</i>, and <i>scherzo</i>
of this symphony as early as 1800 and 1801. We know from sketches
that while he was at work on <i>Fidelio</i> and the pianoforte concerto in
G major&mdash;1804-06&mdash;he was also busied with this symphony, which he
put aside to compose the Fourth symphony, in B flat.</p>
<p>The Symphony in C minor was finished in the neighborhood of
Heiligenstadt in 1807. Dedicated to the Prince von Lobkowitz and
the Count Rasoumowsky, it was published in April, 1809. It was first
performed at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, December 22, 1808.</p>
<p>Instead of inquiring curiously into the legend invented by Schindler&mdash;&ldquo;and
for this reason a statement to be doubted,&rdquo; as B&uuml;low said&mdash;that
Beethoven remarked of the first theme, &ldquo;So knocks Fate on the
door!&rdquo; (it is said that Ferdinand Ries was the author of this explanation
and that Beethoven was grimly sarcastic when Ries, his pupil,
made it known to him), instead of investigating the statement that the
rhythm of this theme was suggested by the note of a bird&mdash;oriole or
goldfinch&mdash;heard during a walk; instead of a long analysis, which is
vexation and confusion without the themes and their variants in notation,
let us read and ponder the words of the great Hector Berlioz:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most celebrated of them all, beyond doubt and peradventure,
is also the first, I think, in which Beethoven gave the reins to his vast
imagination, without taking for guide or aid a foreign thought. In the
First, Second, and Fourth, he more or less enlarged forms already
known, and poetized them with all the brilliant and passionate inspirations
of his vigorous youth. In the Third, the <i>Eroica</i>, there is a tendency,
it is true, to enlarge the form, and the thought is raised to a
mighty height; but it is impossible to ignore the influence of one of
the divine poets to whom for a long time the great artist had raised a
temple in his heart. Beethoven, faithful to the Horatian precept,
&lsquo;<i>Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna</i>,&rsquo; read Homer constantly, and
in his magnificent musical epopee, which, they say, I know not whether
it be true or false, was inspired by a modern hero, the recollections of
the ancient Iliad play a part that is as evident as admirably beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Symphony in C minor, on the other hand, seems to us to
come directly and solely from the genius of Beethoven; he develops
in it his own intimate thought; his secret sorrows, his concentrated
rage, his reveries charged with a dejection, oh, so sad, his visions at
night, his bursts of enthusiasm&mdash;these furnish him the subject; and the
forms of melody, harmony, rhythm, and orchestration are displayed
as essentially individual and new as they are powerful and noble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first movement is devoted to the painting of disordered sentiments
which overthrow a great soul, a prey to despair; not the concentrated,
calm despair that borrows the shape of resignation; not the
dark and voiceless sorrow of Romeo who learns of the death of Juliet;
but the terrible rage of Othello when he receives from Iago&rsquo;s mouth
the poisonous slanders which persuade him of Desdemona&rsquo;s guilt. Now
it is a frenetic delirium which explodes in frightful cries; and now it
is the prostration that has only accents of regret and profound self-pity.
Hear these hiccups of the orchestra, these dialogues in chords
between wind instruments and strings, which come and go, always
weaker and fainter, like unto the painful breathing of a dying man,
and then give way to a phrase full of violence, in which the orchestra
seems to rise to its feet, revived by a flash of fury; see this shuddering
mass hesitate a moment and then rush headlong, divided in two burning
unisons as two streams of lava; ... and then say if this passionate
style is not beyond and above everything that had been produced
hitherto in instrumental music....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>adagio</i>&rdquo; [<i>andante con moto</i>] &ldquo;has characteristics in common
with the <i>allegretto</i> in A minor of the Seventh symphony and the slow
movement of the Fourth. It partakes alike of the melancholy soberness
of the former and the touching grace of the latter. The theme, at
first announced by the united violoncellos and violas, with a simple
accompaniment of the double-basses <i>pizzicato</i>, is followed by a phrase
for wind instruments, which returns constantly, and in the same
tonality throughout the movement, whatever be the successive changes
of the first theme. This persistence of the same phrase, represented
always in a profoundly sad simplicity, produces little by little on the
hearer&rsquo;s soul an indescribable impression....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>scherzo</i> is a strange composition. Its first measures, which are
not terrible themselves, provoke that inexplicable emotion which you
feel when the magnetic gaze of certain persons is fastened on you.
Here everything is somber, mysterious; the orchestration, more or less
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
sinister, springs apparently from the state of mind that created the
famous scene of the Blocksberg in Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. Nuances of <i>piano</i>
and <i>mezzoforte</i> dominate. The trio is a double-bass figure, executed
with the full force of the bow; its savage roughness shakes the orchestral
stands and reminds one of the gambols of a frolicsome elephant.
But the monster retires, and little by little the noise of his mad course
dies away. The theme of the <i>scherzo</i> reappears in <i>pizzicato</i>. Silence
is almost established, for you hear only some violin tones lightly
plucked and strange little cluckings of bassoons.... At last the
strings give gently with the bow the chord of A flat and doze on it.
Only the drums preserve the rhythm; light blows struck by sponge-headed
drumsticks mark the dull rhythm amid the general stagnation
of the orchestra. These drum notes are C&rsquo;s; the tonality of the movement
is C minor; but the chord of A flat sustained for a long time
by the other instruments seems to introduce a different tonality, while
the isolated hammering of the C on the drums tends to preserve the
feeling of the foundation tonality. The ear hesitates&mdash;but will this
mystery of harmony end?&mdash;and the dull pulsations of the drums,
growing louder and louder, reach the violins, which now take part
in the movement and with a change of harmony, to the chord of the
dominant seventh, G, B, D, F, while the drums roll obstinately their
tonic C; the whole orchestra, assisted by the trombones, which have
not yet been heard, bursts in the major into the theme of a triumphal
march, and the <i>finale</i> begins....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criticism has tried, however, to diminish the composer&rsquo;s glory by
stating that he employed ordinary means, the brilliance of the major
mode pompously following the darkness of a <i>pianissimo</i> in minor; that
the triumphal march is without originality, and that the interest wanes
even to the end, whereas it should increase. I reply to this: Did it
require less genius to create a work like this because the passage from
<i>piano</i> to <i>forte</i> and that from minor to major were the means already
understood? Many composers have wished to take advantage of the
same means; and what result did they obtain comparable to this
gigantic chant of victory in which the soul of the poet-musician, henceforth
free from earthly shackles, terrestrial sufferings, seems to mount
radiantly towards heaven? The first four measures of the theme, it is
true, are not highly original, but the forms of a fanfare are inherently
restricted, and I do not think it possible to find new forms without
departing utterly from the simple, grand, pompous character which is
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
becoming. Beethoven wished only an entrance of the fanfare for the
beginning of his <i>finale</i>, and he quickly found in the rest of the movement
and even in the conclusion of the chief theme that loftiness and
originality of style which never forsook him. And this may be said in answer
to the reproach of his not having increased the interest to the very
end; music, in the state known at least to us, would not know how to
produce a more violent effect than that of this transition from <i>scherzo</i> to
triumphal march; it was then impossible to enlarge the effect afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sustain one&rsquo;s self at such a height is of itself a prodigious effort;
yet in spite of the breadth of the developments to which he committed
himself, Beethoven was able to do it. But this equality from the beginning
to end is enough to make the charge of diminished interest
plausible, on account of the terrible shock which the ears receive at
the beginning; a shock that, by exciting nervous emotion to its most
violent paroxysm, makes the succeeding instant the more difficult. In
a long row of columns of equal height, an optical illusion makes the
most remote appear the smallest. Perhaps our weak organization would
accommodate itself to a more laconic peroration, as that of Gluck&rsquo;s
&lsquo;<i>Notre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral vous rappelle</i>.&rsquo; Then the audience would not have to
grow cold, and the symphony would end before weariness had made
impossible further following in the steps of the composer. This remark
bears only on the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the work; it does not do
away with the fact that this <i>finale</i> in itself is rich and magnificent; very
few movements can draw near without being crushed by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When justly read, this symphony is indeed pastoral, light-hearted,
something more than a fearsome length relieved only by
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the little ornithological passage in which nightingale, quail, and
cuckoo are neatly imitated; at least, it is fair to suppose this; we
have never heard the nightingale sing. Jean Cocteau, in his amusing
little book full of aphorisms designed to make the bourgeois
sit up, says that the nightingale sings badly. So we must not be
unduly prejudiced by praise of the bird coming from Milton, Matthew
Arnold, and other poetical enthusiasts. Then there is the
thunderstorm&mdash;the tempest, to use the good country term that has
come down from Shakespeare and before him. And how charming
the first two movements! To borrow the Host&rsquo;s characterization of
Master Fenton, the symphony smells April and May.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony&mdash;<i>Sinfonia pastorale</i>&mdash;was composed in the country
round about Heiligenstadt in the summer of 1808. It was first performed
at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, December 22, 1808. The
descriptive headings were probably an afterthought. In the sketchbook,
which contains sketches for the first movement, is a note: &ldquo;<i>Characteristic
Symphony. The recollections of life in the country.</i>&rdquo; There is also
a note: &ldquo;<i>The hearer is left to find out the situations for himself.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Vincent d&rsquo;Indy in his <i>Beethoven</i> (Paris, 1911) devotes several
pages to Beethoven&rsquo;s love of nature. &ldquo;Nature was to Beethoven not
only a consoler for his sorrows and disenchantments; she was also
a friend with whom he took pleasure in familiar talk, the only intercourse
to which his deafness presented no obstacle.&rdquo; Nor did Beethoven
understand Nature in the dryly theoretical manner of Jean
Jacques Rousseau, whose writings then were in fashion, for there
could be no point of contact between the doctrines of this Calvinist
of Geneva and the effusions of Beethoven, a Catholic by birth and by
education. Nor did Beethoven share the views of many Romantics
about Nature. He would never have called her &ldquo;immense, impenetrable,
and haughty,&rdquo; as Berlioz addressed her through the mouth of
his Faust. A little nook, a meadow, a tree&mdash;these sufficed for Beethoven.
He had so penetrated the beauty of nature that for more than
a dozen years all his music was impregnated by it.</p>
<p>His bedside book for many, many years soon after his passion for
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
Giulietta Guicciardi was the <i>Lehr und Erbauungs Buch</i> of Sturm. Passages
underscored show the truth of the assertions just made, and he
copied these lines that they might always be in his sight: &ldquo;Nature can
be justly called the school of the heart; it shows us beyond all doubt
our duty towards God and our Neighbor. I wish therefore to become a
disciple of this school, and offer my heart to it. Desirous of self-instruction,
I wish to search after the wisdom that no disillusion can reject;
I wish to arrive at the knowledge of God, and in this knowledge
I shall find a foretaste of celestial joys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nature to Beethoven was the country near by, which he could visit
in his daily walks. If he was an indefatigable pedestrian, he was never
an excursionist.</p>
<p>M. d&rsquo;Indy draws a picture of the little <i>Wirthschaften</i> in the suburbs
of the large towns, humble inns &ldquo;not yet ticketed with the pompous
barbarism of &lsquo;restaurant.&rsquo;&rdquo; They were frequented by the bourgeoisie,
who breathed the fresh air and on tables of wood ate the habitual
sausage and drank the traditional beer. There was a dance hall with a
small orchestra; there was a discreet garden with odorous alleys in
which lovers could walk between the dances. Beyond was the forest
where the peasant danced and sang and drank, but the songs and
dances were here of a ruder nature.</p>
<p>Beethoven, renting a cottage at D&ouml;bling, Grinzing, or Heiligenstadt,
which then were not official faubourgs, could in a few minutes be in
the forest or open country. He did not attempt to reproduce the
material, realistic impression of country sounds and noises, but only
the spirit of the landscape.</p>
<p>Thus in the <i>Pastoral</i> symphony, to suggest the rustic calm and
the tranquillity of the soul in contact with Nature, he did not seek
curious harmonic conglomerations, but a simple, restrained melody
which embraces only the interval of a sixth (from <i>fa</i> to <i>re</i>). This is
enough to create in us the sentiment of repose&mdash;as much by its quasi-immobility
as by the duration of this immobility. The exposition of this
melody based on the interval of a sixth is repeated with different
timbres, but musically the same, for fifty-two measures without interruption.
In an analogous manner Wagner portrayed the majestic
monotony of the river in the introduction to <i>Rheingold</i>. Thus far the
landscape is uninhabited. The second musical idea introduces two
human beings, man and woman, force and tenderness. The second
musical thought is the thematic base of the whole work. In the <i>scherzo</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
the effect of sudden immobility produced by the bagpipe tune of the
strolling musician (the oboe solo, followed by the horn), imposing
itself on the noisy joy of the peasants, is due to the cause named
above; here, with the exception of one note, the melody moves within
the interval of a fifth.</p>
<p>The storm does not pretend to frighten the hearer. The insufficient
kettledrums are enough to suggest the thunder, but in four movements
of the five there is not a fragment of development in the minor
mode. The key of F minor, reserved for the darkening of the landscape
hitherto sunny and gay, produces a sinking of the heart and
the distressing restlessness that accompany the approach of the tempest.
Calm returns with the <i>ambitus</i> of the sixth, and then the shepherd&rsquo;s
song leads to a burst of joyfulness. The two themes are the masculine
and feminine elements exposed in the first movement.</p>
<p>According to M. d&rsquo;Indy the <i>andante</i> is the most admirable expression
of true nature in musical literature. Only some passages of <i>Siegfried</i>
and <i>Parsifal</i> are comparable. Conductors usually take this <i>andante</i>
at too slow a pace and thus destroy the alert poetry of the section. The
brook furnishes the basic movement, expressive melodies arise, and
the feminine theme of the first <i>allegro</i> reappears, alone, disquieted by
the absence of its mate. Each section is completed by a pure and prayer-like
melody. It is the artist who prays, who loves, who crowns the
diverse divisions of his work by a species of Alleluia.</p>
<p>It has been said that several of the themes in this symphony were
taken from Styrian and Carinthian folk songs. It is dedicated to
Prince von Lobkowitz and Count Rasoumowsky. The work was published
in 1809.</p>

<p>The rhapsodists have had their say; the commentators have
pried and conjectured; the later symphonies are still sublime in
their grandeur. They well-nigh express the inexpressible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Nor have the legends, fondly believed for years, done injury to
the music. It matters not whether the Seventh symphony be a description
of Germany exulting in its deliverance from the French
yoke, or the apotheosis of the dance; whether the allegretto picture
a procession in the catacombs or be the love dream of an odalisque.
Whenever the music is played, whenever it comes into the mind,
it awakens new thoughts and each one dreams his own dreams.</p>
<p>Each writer in turn publishes in print or by word of mouth his
little explanation, but Beethoven broods, mysterious, gigantic,
above commentators, above even conductors when they misunderstand
him, or plume themselves upon a new and striking interpretation,
or in their endeavor to grasp and convey to others the
essential greatness of the composer put their trust in din and speed.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The first sketches of this symphony were probably made before 1811
or even 1810. The score of the symphony was dedicated to the Count
Moritz von Fries and published in 1816. The edition for the pianoforte
was dedicated to the Tsarina Elizabeth Alexievna of All the
Russias.</p>
<p>The Seventh and Eighth symphonies were probably played over for
the first time at the Archduke Rudolph&rsquo;s in Vienna on April 20, 1813.
Beethoven in the same month vainly endeavored to produce them at
a concert. The first performance of the Seventh was at Vienna in the
large hall of the university, on December 8, 1813.</p>
<p>M&auml;lzel, the famous maker of automata, exhibited in Vienna during
the winter of 1812-13 his automatic trumpeter and panharmonicon.
The former played a French cavalry march with calls and tunes; the
latter was composed of the instruments used in the ordinary military
band of the period&mdash;trumpets, drums, flutes, clarinets, oboes, cymbals,
triangle, etc. The keys were moved by a cylinder. Overtures by Handel
and Cherubini and Haydn&rsquo;s Military symphony were played with ease
and precision. Beethoven planned his <i>Wellington&rsquo;s Victory</i>, or <i>Battle of
Vittoria</i>, for this machine. M&auml;lzel made arrangements for a concert&mdash;a
concert &ldquo;for the benefit of Austrian and Bavarian soldiers disabled
at the battle of Hanau.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>This Johann Nepomuk M&auml;lzel (M&auml;lzl) was born at Regensburg,
August 15, 1772. He was the son of an organ builder. In 1792 he
settled at Vienna as a teacher of music, but he soon made a name
for himself by inventing mechanical music works. In 1816 he constructed
a metronome, though Winkel, of Amsterdam, claimed the
idea as his. M&auml;lzel also made ear trumpets, and Beethoven tried
them, as he did others. His life was a singular one, and the accounts
of it are contradictory. Two leading French biographical dictionaries
insist that M&auml;lzel&rsquo;s &ldquo;brother Leonhard&rdquo; invented the mechanical toys
attributed to Johann, but they are wholly wrong. F&eacute;tis and one or two
others state that he took the panharmonicon with him to the United
States in 1826 and sold it at Boston to a society for four hundred
thousand dollars&mdash;an incredible statement. No wonder that the Count
de Pont&eacute;coulant, in his <i>Organographie</i>, repeating the statement, adds,
&ldquo;I think there is an extra cipher.&rdquo; But M&auml;lzel did visit America, and he
spent several years here. He landed at New York, February 3, 1826,
and the <i>Ship News</i> announced the arrival of &ldquo;Mr. Maelzel, Professor
of Music and Mechanics, inventor of the Panharmonicon and the Musical
Time Keeper.&rdquo; He brought with him the famous automata&mdash;the
Chess Player, the Austrian Trumpeter, and the Rope Dancers&mdash;and
opened an exhibition of them at the National Hotel, 112 Broadway,
April 13, 1826. The Chess Player was invented by Wolfgang von
Kempelen. M&auml;lzel bought it at the sale of von Kempelen&rsquo;s effects after
the death of the latter, at Vienna, and made unimportant improvements.
The Chess Player had strange adventures. It was owned for a time
by Eug&egrave;ne Beauharnais, when he was viceroy of the kingdom of Italy,
and M&auml;lzel had much trouble in getting it away from him. M&auml;lzel gave
an exhibition in Boston at Julien Hall, on a corner of Milk and Congress
streets. The exhibition opened September 13, 1826, and closed
October 28 of that year. He visited Boston again in 1828 and
1833. On his second visit he added <i>The Conflagration of Moscow</i>, a
panorama, which he sold to three Bostonians for six thousand dollars.
Hence, probably, the origin of the panharmonicon legend. He also
exhibited an automatic violoncellist. M&auml;lzel died on the brig <i>Otis</i> on
his way from Havana to Philadelphia on July 21, 1838, and was buried
at sea, off Charleston. The <i>United States Gazette</i> published his eulogy
and said, with due caution: &ldquo;He has gone, we hope, where the music
of his harmonicons will be exceeded.&rdquo; The Chess Player was destroyed
by fire in the burning of the Chinese Museum at Philadelphia, July 5,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
1854. An interesting and minute account of M&auml;lzel&rsquo;s life in America,
written by George Allen, is published in the <i>Book of the First American
Chess Congress</i>, pp. 420-84 (New York, 1859); see also <i>M&eacute;tronome de
Maelzel</i> (Paris, 1833); the <i>History of the Automatic Chess Player</i>, published
by George S. Hilliard, Boston, 1826; Mendel&rsquo;s <i>Musikalisches
Conversations-Lexicon</i>; and an article, <i>Beethoven and Chess</i>, by Charles
Willing, published in <i>The Good Companion Chess Problem Club</i> of
May 11, 1917 (Philadelphia), which contains facsimiles of M&auml;lzel&rsquo;s
programmes in Philadelphia (1845) and Montreal (1847). In Poe&rsquo;s
fantastical &ldquo;Von Kempelen and His Discovery&rdquo; the description of his
Kempelen, of Utica, N. Y., is said by some to fit M&auml;lzel, but Poe&rsquo;s
story was probably not written before 1848. His article, &ldquo;Maelzel&rsquo;s Chess
Player,&rdquo; a remarkable analysis, was first published in the <i>Southern
Literary Messenger</i> of April, 1836. Portions of this article other than
those pertaining to the analysis were taken by Poe from Sir David
Brewster&rsquo;s <i>Lectures on Natural Magic</i>.</p>
<p>The programme of the Vienna concert was announced: &ldquo;A brand-new
symphony,&rdquo; the Seventh, in A major, by Beethoven; and also
<i>Wellington&rsquo;s Sieg, oder die Schlacht bei Vittoria</i>. <i>Wellington&rsquo;s Sieg</i> was
completed in October, 1813, to celebrate the victory of Wellington over
the French troops in Spain on June 21 of that year. M&auml;lzel had persuaded
Beethoven to compose the piece for his panharmonicon. He
furnished material for it and gave him the idea of using &ldquo;God Save
the King&rdquo; as the subject of a lively fugue. He purposed to produce the
work at concerts, so as to raise money enough for him and Beethoven
to visit London. A shrewd fellow, he said that if the &ldquo;<i>Battle</i>&rdquo; symphony
were scored for orchestra and played in Vienna with success, an arrangement
for his panharmonicon would then be of more value to
him. Beethoven dedicated the work to the Prince Regent, afterwards
George IV, and forwarded a copy to him, but the &ldquo;First Gentleman in
Europe&rdquo; never acknowledged the compliment. <i>Wellington&rsquo;s Sieg</i> was
not performed in London until February 10, 1815, when it had a great
run. The news of this success pleased Beethoven very much. He made a
memorandum of it in the notebook which he carried with him to
taverns.</p>
<p>The benefit concert was brilliantly successful, and there was a repetition
of it December 12 with the same prices of admission, ten and five
florins. The net profit of the two performances was four thousand six
gulden. Spohr tells us that the new pieces gave &ldquo;extraordinary pleasure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
especially the symphony; the wondrous second movement was repeated
at each concert; it made a deep, enduring impression on me.
The performance was a masterly one, in spite of the uncertain and
often ridiculous conducting by Beethoven.&rdquo; Gl&ouml;ggl was present at a
rehearsal when violinists refused to play a passage in the symphony
and declared that it could not be played. &ldquo;Beethoven told them to
take their parts home and practise them; then the passage would surely
go.&rdquo; It was at these rehearsals that Spohr saw the deaf composer
crouch lower and lower to indicate a long <i>diminuendo</i>, and rise again
and spring into the air when he demanded a climax. And he tells of
a pathetic yet ludicrous blunder of Beethoven, who could not hear the
soft passages.</p>
<p>Beethoven was delighted with his success, so much so that he
wrote a public letter of thanks to all that took part in the two performances.
&ldquo;It is M&auml;lzel especially who merits all our thanks. He was
the first to conceive the idea of the concert, and it was he who busied
himself actively with the organization and the ensemble in all the
details. I owe him special thanks for having given me the opportunity
of offering my compositions to the public use and thus fulfilling the
ardent vow made by me long ago of putting the fruits of my labor
on the altar of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement opens with an introduction, <i>poco sostenuto</i>, A
major, 4-4. The main body is <i>vivace</i>, 6-8. The <i>allegretto</i> is in A minor,
2-4; the third movement, <i>presto</i>, F major, 3-4. The <i>finale</i>, <i>allegro con
brio</i>, A major, 2-4, is a wild rondo on two themes. Here, according to
Mr. Prod&rsquo;homme and others, as Beethoven achieved in the <i>scherzo</i> the
highest and fullest expression of exuberant joy&mdash;&ldquo;unbuttoned joy,&rdquo; as
the composer himself would have said&mdash;so in the <i>finale</i> the joy becomes
orgiastic. The furious bacchantic first theme is repeated after the exposition,
and there is a sort of coda to it, &ldquo;as a chorus might follow upon
the stanzas of a song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Beethoven characterized his Eighth symphony as &ldquo;a little symphony&rdquo;
and in the same letter spoke of the Seventh as a great one;
yet if Czerny is to be believed the composer was vexed because
the audience was cool when the Eighth was first performed. He
said, &ldquo;because it is much better&rdquo; than the Seventh, which was
played at the same concert. Authors often pronounce strange judgments
on their works, as parents often favor a stupid or unpleasant
child; but this composer had a right to be proud of the little
Benjamin&mdash;the colossal Ninth was not then born&mdash;for the Eighth
symphony is charged with the spirit of the greater Beethoven.</p>
<p>Some commentators have endeavored to read a programme into
the symphony, thinking perhaps thus to give it greater importance.
One speaks of the symphony as a &ldquo;military trilogy&rdquo;; another thinks
the <i>allegretto</i> is a parody of Rossini&rsquo;s manner, but the movement
was written in 1812, and Vienna did not go mad over the Olympian
Rossini until after that year. We even find Vincent d&rsquo;Indy
citing the Eighth as revealing impressions of Nature made on the
composer&rsquo;s soul; the trio of the pompous minuet is to M. d&rsquo;Indy
a representation in grotesque fashion of a peasant band, and the
Hungarian theme in the <i>finale</i>, the hymn of Hunyadi, denotes the
arrival of gypsy musicians in the midst of a festival.</p>
<p>The symphony needs not such support to excite extraneous interest.
In the music we find Beethoven in reckless mood, whimsical,
delighting in abrupt contrasts, shouting his joy, ready to play a
practical joke. There is, no doubt, the absence of the &ldquo;fine taste&rdquo;
which Debussy misses in the case of Beethoven and finds ruling
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the musical life of Bach and Mozart. No, Beethoven was not
Paterian in a struggle after taste. He was an elemental person,
coarse in his life, with an enormous capacity for hard work. There
are others who have been condemned for a lack of taste: Euripides,
Rabelais, Shakespeare, Verdi, Walt Whitman. De Quincey, a stylist,
found Goethe lacking in taste when he wrote <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>.</p>
<p>And in this symphony, characterized by mad jollity, and a playfulness
that at times approaches buffoonery, there are exquisite
musical thoughts; there are passages that for a moment sound the
depths and reach the heights.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The Eighth symphony was composed at Linz in the summer of 1812.
Beethoven was in poor physical condition in that year, and as Staudenheim,
his physician, advised him to try Bohemian baths, he went to
T&ouml;plitz by way of Prague; to Carlsbad, where a note of the postillion&rsquo;s
horn found its way among the sketches for the Eighth symphony; to
Franzensbrunn, and again to T&ouml;plitz; and lastly to his brother Johann&rsquo;s
home at Linz, where he remained until into November.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1812 Beethoven contemplated writing three
symphonies at the same time; the key of the third, D minor, was already
determined, but he postponed work on this; and as the autograph
score of the first of the remaining two, the Symphony in A, No. 7, is
dated May 13, it is probable that he contemplated the Seventh before
he left Vienna on his summer journey. His sojourn in Linz was not a
pleasant one. Johann, a bachelor, lived in a house too large for his needs,
and so he rented a part of it to a physician, who had a sister-in-law,
Therese Obermeyer, a cheerful and well-proportioned woman of an
agreeable if not handsome face. Johann looked on her kindly, made her
his housekeeper, and according to the gossips of Linz, there was a
closer relationship. Beethoven meddled with his brother&rsquo;s affairs, and,
finding him obdurate, visited the bishop and the police authorities and
persuaded them to banish her from the town, to send her to Vienna if
she should still be in Linz on a fixed day. Naturally, there was a wild
scene between the brothers. Johann played the winning card: he married
Therese on November 8. Ludwig, furious, went back to Vienna and
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
took pleasure afterwards in referring to his sister-in-law in both his
conversation and his letters as the &ldquo;Queen of Night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This same Johann said that the Eighth symphony was completed
from sketches made during walks to and from the P&ouml;stlingberge, but
Thayer considered him to be an untrustworthy witness.</p>
<p>The two symphonies were probably played over the first time at the
Archduke Rudolph&rsquo;s in Vienna, April 20, 1813. Beethoven in the same
month endeavored to produce them at a concert, but without success.
The Seventh was not played until December 8, 1813, at a concert
organized by M&auml;lzel. The first performance of the Eighth symphony
was at a concert given by Beethoven at Vienna in the Redoutensaal on
Sunday, February 27, 1814.</p>
<p>The <i>Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung</i>, in a review of this concert, stated
that the Seventh symphony was again heartily applauded, and the
<i>allegro</i> was repeated. &ldquo;All were in anxious expectation to hear the
new symphony (F major, 3-4), the latest product of Beethoven&rsquo;s muse;
but this expectation <i>after one hearing</i> was not fully satisfied, and the
applause which the work received was not of that enthusiastic nature
by which a work that pleases universally is distinguished. In short, the
symphony did not make, as the Italians say, a <i>furore</i>. I am of the opinion
that the cause of this was not in weaker or less artistic workmanship
(for in this, as in all of Beethoven&rsquo;s works of this species, breathes the
peculiar genius which always proves his originality), but partly in the
mistake of allowing this symphony to follow the one in A major, and
partly in the satiety that followed the enjoyment of so much that was
beautiful and excellent, whereby natural apathy was the result. If this
symphony in future should be given alone, I have no doubt concerning
its favorable reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were in the orchestra at this concert eighteen first violins,
eighteen second violins, fourteen violas, twelve violoncellos, seven
double basses. The audience numbered about three thousand, although
Schindler spoke of five thousand.</p>
<p>We know from his talk noted down that Beethoven originally
planned an elaborate introduction to this symphony.</p>
<p>It is often said that the second movement, the celebrated <i>allegretto
scherzando</i>, is based on the theme of a &ldquo;three-voice circular canon, or
round, <i>Ta, ta, ta, lieber M&auml;lzel</i>, sung in honor of the inventor of the
metronome at a farewell dinner given to Beethoven in July, 1812,
before his leaving Vienna for his summer trip into the country.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
This story was first told by Schindler, who, however, did not say
that the dinner was given to Beethoven alone, and did say that
the dinner was in the spring of 1812. Beethoven was about to visit
his brother Johann in Linz; M&auml;lzel was going to England to produce
there his automaton trumpeter but was obliged to defer this journey.
Beethoven, who among intimate friends was customarily &ldquo;gay, witty,
satiric, &lsquo;unbuttoned,&rsquo; as he called it,&rdquo; improvised at this parting meal
a canon, which was sung immediately by those present. The <i>allegretto</i>
was founded on this canon, suggested by the metronome, according to
Schindler. Thayer<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> examined this story with incredible patience, and
he drew these conclusions: the machine that we now know as M&auml;lzel&rsquo;s
metronome was at first called a musical chronometer, and not until
1817 could the canon include the word &ldquo;Metronom.&rdquo; Schindler, who
was seventeen years old in 1812, heard the story from Count Brunswick,
who was present at the meal, but was not in Vienna from March, 1810,
till the end of February, 1813, four months after the completion of the
symphony. Furthermore, Beethoven is reported as having said: &ldquo;I, too,
am in the second movement of the Eighth symphony&mdash;ta, ta, ta, ta&mdash;the
canon on M&auml;lzel. It was a right jolly evening when we sang this canon.
M&auml;lzel was the bass. At that time I sang the soprano. I think it was
toward the end of December, 1817.&rdquo; Thayer says: &ldquo;That M&auml;lzel&rsquo;s &lsquo;ta, ta,
ta&rsquo; suggested the <i>allegretto</i> to Beethoven, and that at a parting meal
the canon on this theme was sung, are doubtless true; but it is by no
means sure that the canon preceded the symphony.... If the canon
was written before the symphony, it was not improvised at this meal;
if it was then improvised, it was only a repetition of the <i>allegretto</i> theme
in canon form.&rdquo; However this may be, the persistent ticking of a wind
instrument in sixteenth notes is heard almost throughout the movement,
of which Berlioz said: &ldquo;It is one of those productions for which
neither model nor pendant can be found. This sort of thing falls entire
from heaven into the composer&rsquo;s brain. He writes it at a single dash,
and we are amazed at hearing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much has been written about the Ninth symphony, a symphony
that has been and is a stumbling block to certain conductors and
hearers. It is easy to smile at such books as <i>Le Livre de la Gen&egrave;se
de la IX Symphonie de Beethoven</i>, by Ricciotto Canudo, with its
fantastical theories and titles given to the leading themes, but the
comments of more ordinary mortals have led conductors into singular
experiments. Some have rewritten passages. Some, fearing
the inherent difficulties in the <i>finale</i>, have transposed this <i>finale</i> a
tone lower. There are hearers who, knowing the theory of Wagner&mdash;that
the Ninth symphony was the logical end of purely instrumental
music, and Beethoven introduced singers in the finale to
show his impatience with the orchestra as a medium of full expression&mdash;look
on the symphony as a polemical work and in turn deny
all absolute music written after Beethoven&rsquo;s death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The music remains, in spite of the commentators and the too
anxious conductors. The instrumental movements are among the
proudest achievements of man. Mr. Canudo may begin his &ldquo;explanation&rdquo;
of the opening <i>allegro</i> by saying: &ldquo;In the beginning was
space; and all possibilities were in space; and life was space&rdquo;; he
may find in a certain page the &ldquo;religious affirmation of Creation&rdquo;;
he may entitle the first theme of the <i>adagio</i> &ldquo;The rhythm of the
blessed cosmic night&rdquo; and thus take his pleasure.</p>
<p>The music of the first three movements is not the less sublime
or beautiful because it has no programme, because it has no text for
singers. With the exception of a few stupendous passages in the
<i>finale</i>, where Beethoven is among the stars, the <i>finale</i> falls below
the movements that precede it. There is more frenzied joy in the
<i>scherzo</i>; there is greater, world-embracing humanity, a loftier,
nobler spirit in the <i>adagio</i>. The theme of Joy is not in itself one of
Beethoven&rsquo;s most fortunate inventions, and there are pages both
for singers and for orchestra that disconcert even if they do not
seem to the hearer abnormal and impotent. The answer made by
some is that if an ideal performance could be attained the grandeur
of the thought would then be overwhelming. Unfortunately, human
voices have their limitations.</p>
<p>Yet if the first three movements are performed alone, there is a
sense of incompleteness. If the <i>finale</i> is transposed, the effect is
diminished. And so the Ninth symphony as a whole is still a
stumbling block to many.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Beethoven made sketches for his Ninth symphony as early as 1815.
The symphony was completed about February, 1824. The idea of adding
a chorus to the last movement probably came to him only in the course
of his work, for there are sketches of a purely instrumental <i>finale</i>
which Nottebohm says were made in June or July, 1823; but Schiller&rsquo;s
<i>Hymn to Joy</i> had long tempted Beethoven. At Bonn, in 1792, he
thought of setting music to it. His <i>Fantaisie</i> for piano, orchestra, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
chorus (1800) contains the melodic germ that he afterwards used for
Schiller&rsquo;s words. Perhaps the &ldquo;mother melody&rdquo; may be found in a
folk song, &ldquo;Freu&rsquo; dich sehr, O meine Selle, und vergiss&rsquo; all&rsquo; Noth und
Qual.&rdquo; Wasielewski thinks the origin is in a song of Beethoven&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;Kleine Bl&uuml;men, kleine Bl&auml;tter,&rdquo; with text by Goethe, while the music
was composed in 1810.</p>
<p>According to Beethoven&rsquo;s sketchbooks, he was planning two symphonies;
one, for England, was to be purely instrumental; the other
was the <i>Sinfonie allemand</i>, either with variations after the chorus
when it entered, or without variations; the <i>finale</i> with &ldquo;Turkish music&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, bass drum, cymbals, and triangle&mdash;&ldquo;and choral song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1817, there was correspondence between the Philharmonic
Society of London and Beethoven with reference to the latter&rsquo;s visiting
England. He was offered 300 guineas if he would come to London and
superintend the production of two symphonies to be composed for the
Society. Beethoven asked for 400 guineas; 150 to be paid in advance
(one hundred were for traveling expenses). The previous offer was
repeated, but Beethoven abandoned his intention of going to London.</p>
<p>At the first performance of the Ninth symphony in England (March
21, 1825), the programme read: &ldquo;New Grand Characteristic Sinfonia,
MS. with vocal <i>finale</i>, the principal parts to be sung by Madame
Caradori, Miss Goodall, Mr. Vaughan, and Mr. Phillips; <i>composed
expressly for this Society</i>.&rdquo; There was also a note in which it was said
that in 1822 the directors of the Philharmonic had offered Beethoven
&pound;50 for a symphony to be delivered at the stipulated time; and as it had
been performed and published at Vienna before the Society could
use it, the remuneration was ample. It should be remembered that the
Philharmonic Society, learning of Beethoven&rsquo;s sickness in 1827, sent
him &pound;100. Beethoven acknowledged in most grateful terms, eight days
before his death, the receipt of the sum given him by these &ldquo;generous&rdquo;
Englishmen, and spoke of a tenth symphony wholly sketched, also a
new overture, that he might send to them. He had written to Ries in
1823 that only his poverty compelled him to write the Ninth symphony
for the Philharmonic; he had sent to it the overture <i>The Dedication of
the House</i>, and he asked Ries to drive as good a bargain as he could
for it. He had been vexed because the Philharmonic Society had
characterized three overtures delivered for 75 guineas in 1815: <i>Ruins
of Athens</i>, <i>King Stephen</i>, and <i>Zur Namensfeier</i>, as &ldquo;unworthy&rdquo; of the
composer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>After Beethoven&rsquo;s death, the Philharmonic Society reclaimed the gift
of &pound;100, but was persuaded to withdraw the claim. A portion of the
money was applied to the payment of the funeral expenses.</p>
<p>The first performance of the Ninth symphony was at the K&auml;rthnerthor
Theater, Vienna, on May 7, 1824. Musicians and wealthy amateurs
organized the concert, for the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde had refused
the undertaking on account of the expense. Beethoven then proposed
to give the first performance of the symphony and the great
Mass in Berlin, where Count Br&uuml;hl, the Intendant of the Royal theaters
there, was favorably inclined. This led the Viennese patrons and
musicians to sign a petition, begging Beethoven to spare Vienna the
shame. He reflected, and consented. The programme, approved by
the police, was as follows: Grand Overture, Op. 124; Three Grand
Hymns for solo voices and chorus; Grand Symphony with a <i>finale</i> in
which solo voices and chorus enter, on the text of Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to
Joy.&rdquo; The three &ldquo;Hymns&rdquo; were the <i>Kyrie</i>, <i>Credo</i>, <i>Agnus Dei</i>, of the
Mass in D. Sedlinsky, the chief of police, acting on the advice of the
Archbishop, had forbidden the printing of &ldquo;Sacred words&rdquo; on a play-bill,
and the church authorities were opposed to the performance of
missal music in a theater.</p>
<p>The solo singers were Henriette Sontag, Karolina Unger, Anton
Haitzinger, and J. Seipelt. The chorus was composed of amateurs from
the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. Ignaz Schuppanzigh was the concertmaster;
Michael Umlauf conducted. Beethoven asked for twenty-four
violins, ten violas, twelve violoncellos and double basses, and a
doubling of wind instruments. The rehearsals were laborious. The
solo singers had great difficulty in learning their parts. Mmes Sontag
and Unger begged Beethoven to make changes in their music. He was
obdurate. Mme Unger called him to his face &ldquo;tyrant over all the vocal
organs.&rdquo; When he refused to change the music, she said to Mme Sontag:
&ldquo;Well, then we must go on torturing ourselves in the name of
God.&rdquo; The success of the symphony was great, though the performance
was imperfect. &ldquo;There was lack of homogeneous power, a paucity
of nuance, a poor distribution of lights and shades.&rdquo; When the drum
alone beat the <i>scherzo</i> motive, the audience applauded so that a repetition
seemed inevitable. (It was of the <i>scherzo</i> that Rossini, hearing the
symphony in Paris, exclaimed, &ldquo;I could not have written that.&rdquo;)
Mme Unger led Beethoven to the edge of the stage that he might see
the crowd waving hats and handkerchiefs. He bowed and was calm.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Mme Grebner, who had sung in the chorus, told Felix Weingartner
that Beethoven sat in the middle of the orchestra and followed the score.
Thalberg, the pianist, who was in the audience, told A. W. Thayer
that Beethoven was dressed in a black dress-coat, white neckerchief
and waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, black silk stockings, shoes with
buckles; but Thalberg was mistaken if Schindler&rsquo;s story is true, for he
called on Beethoven just before the concert and said, &ldquo;O great master,
you do not own a black frock-coat! The green one will have to do.
The theater will be dark, and no one will notice it. In a few days the
black one will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The success was unprecedented; the net pecuniary result was a sum
equivalent to sixty dollars. Beethoven was angry. Some days after the
concert, dining in a restaurant with Schindler and Duport, he accused
them of having swindled him; nor would he be persuaded by Schuppanzigh
that the charge was absurd, for Beethoven&rsquo;s brother Johann
and nephew Karl had watched the cashiers.</p>
<p>There was a second performance in Vienna on May 23, 1824, in the
large Hall of the Redoutes. Duport assumed all the expenses, and
guaranteed Beethoven 500 florins. The programme was not the same,
but it included the symphony, the <i>Kyrie</i>, and the overture. The hour,
noon, was unfavorable. Duport lost some hundreds of florins. These
were the only performances at which Beethoven could be present.</p>
<p>Beethoven had purposed to dedicate the symphony to the Tsar
Alexander; he finally dedicated it to Friedrich Wilhelm III, the King
of Prussia. The King answered, expressing appreciation, and saying
that he had sent to him a diamond ring. The gem turned out to be
not a diamond, but a reddish stone valued by the court jeweler at 300
florins in paper money. The indignant Beethoven was inclined to return
the ring; but he sold it to the jeweler who had appraised it. Some
thought that the &ldquo;reddish stone&rdquo; had been substituted for the diamond
ring on the way to Vienna.</p>
<p>Though Beethoven had long been fond of Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to Joy,&rdquo;
the Ninth symphony was not conceived at first as a celebration of
joy. In 1818, he had the plan of introducing voices into a symphony
&ldquo;in the ancient modes,&rdquo; but the text was to be relating to some Greek
myth, or a pious song.</p>
<p>The symphony begins <i>Allegro ma non troppo</i>, D minor, 2-4; but
the chief theme, though hinted at, does not appear until after sixteen
measures. There is a continuous melodic development which may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
divided into several distinct periods, but there is no marked contrast
in character between what might be called eight separate themes.</p>
<p>The second movement, <i>molto vivace</i>, D minor, 3-4, is a <i>scherzo</i>,
though it is not so called in the score. It is built on three leading
themes. The peculiar rhythm of the dotted triplet is maintained either
in the melody or in the accompaniment.</p>
<p>The third movement, <i>adagio molto e cantabile</i>, B flat major, 4-4, has
been described as a double theme with variations.</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i> begins with several orchestral sections, the first <i>presto</i>, D
minor, 3-4. There are recitatives for the lower strings. Finally, the baritone
enters with this recitative:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>O brothers, these sad tones no longer!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Rather raise we now together our voices,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And joyful be our song!</i></p>
</div>
<p><i>Allegro assai</i>, D major, 4-5. The baritone &ldquo;with the encouragement
of the basses of the choruses at the beginning,&rdquo; sings the first theme.
Then follow passages for chorus, quartet, until the tempo changes to
<i>allegro assai vivace alla marcia</i>, B flat major, 6-8. There are later
changes in tempo until the final <i>prestissimo</i>, &ldquo;in which the chorus goes
stark mad with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following translation of Schiller&rsquo;s ode is by the late Henry G.
Chapman:</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO &ldquo;LEONORE NO. 3,&rdquo; OP. 72</span></h2>
<p>The overture is in itself a condensation of what is dramatic in
an opera that has commonplace, yes, bourgeois pages. Hearing the
overture, one is spared the sight of a bulbous and shrieking prima
donna; of a tenor whose throat had been seriously affected by a
long confinement in a &ldquo;dem&rsquo;d moist&rdquo; dungeon; of the operetta
young man and woman chatting with a flatiron among the stage
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
properties; of four persons, each with an individual sentiment,
singing the same tune in an approved scholastic form.</p>
<p class="tb">It might be well to play in the same concert the three Leonore
overtures in the order in which they were probably written: Nos.
2, 3, 1. A programme composed exclusively of piano sonatas by
Beethoven is an invention of the Adversary, and it deserves the
attention of the police as a deliberate act against public morals.
Nor is an orchestral programme devoted exclusively to the works
of any composer to be encouraged, except possibly when the Ninth
symphony is given. But with these overtures the case is different,
for here is a revelation of Beethoven&rsquo;s processes of musical and
dramatic thought when he was mightily interested in the same subject....
How many composers, after the achievement of a
<i>Leonore No. 2</i>, would have the courage or the ability to shape
from it a <i>Leonore No. 3</i>? After the three were attentively heard
and thoughtfully considered, then <i>No. 3</i> might be reasonably reserved
for concert use and the other two put away ready but
surely on the shelf.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>In the year that saw the production of <i>Fidelio</i> (November 20, 1805),
Napoleon&rsquo;s army was hastening toward Vienna. There was an exodus
from the town of the nobility, merchants, and other residents. The
vanguard of the French army entered on November 13. Those of the
Viennese who would have appreciated the opera had fled the town. The
theater was not well filled. Many in the audience were or had been officers
in Napoleon&rsquo;s army. The success of the opera was small. Only
two performances followed the first. At the first and at the second the
overture <i>Leonore No. 2</i> was performed. Anna Pauline Milder, afterwards
Mme Hauptmann, was the heroine. &ldquo;The opera was hastily put
upon the stage, and the inadequacy of the singers thus increased by the
lack of sufficient rehearsals.&rdquo; Beethoven had received the text in 1804.
He worked on the music the following summer at Hetzendorf. On his
return to Vienna, rehearsals were begun. In later years <i>Fidelio</i> was one
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
of Anna Milder&rsquo;s great parts: &ldquo;Judging from the contemporary criticism,
it was now [1805] somewhat defective, simply from lack of
stage experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Leonore No. 2</i> was the overture played at the first performance in
Vienna. The opera was withdrawn, revised, and produced again on
March 29, 1806, when <i>Leonore No. 3</i>, a remodeled form of <i>No. 2</i>, was
the overture. There was talk of a performance at Prague in 1807.
Beethoven wrote for it a new overture, retaining the theme derived from
Florestan&rsquo;s air, &ldquo;In des Lebens Fr&uuml;lingstagen.&rdquo; The other material in
<i>Nos. 2</i> and <i>3</i> was not used. The opera was not performed; the autograph
of the overture disappeared. <i>Fidelio</i> was revived at Vienna in
1814. For this performance Beethoven wrote the <i>Fidelio</i> overture. We
know from his diary that he &ldquo;rewrote and bettered&rdquo; the opera by
working on it from March to May 15 of that year.</p>
<p>The dress rehearsal was on May 22, but the promised overture was
not ready. On the 20th or 21st, Beethoven was dining at a tavern
with his friend Bartolini. After the meal was over, Beethoven took
a bill of fare, drew lines on the back of it, and began to write. &ldquo;Come,
let us go,&rdquo; said Bartolini. &ldquo;No, wait a while: I have the scheme of my
overture,&rdquo; answered Beethoven, and he sat until he had finished his
sketches. Nor was he at the dress rehearsal. They waited for him a
long time, then went to his lodgings. He was fast asleep in bed. A
cup of wine and biscuits were near him, and sheets of the overture
were on the bed and the floor. The candle was burnt out. It was impossible
to use the new overture, which was not even finished. Schindler
said a <i>Leonore</i> overture was played. According to Seyfried, the overture
used was that to <i>The Ruins of Athens</i>.</p>
<p>The order, then, of these overtures, according to the time of composition,
is now supposed to be <i>Leonore No. 2</i>, <i>Leonore No. 3</i>, <i>Leonore
No. 1</i>, <i>Fidelio</i>. It was said that <i>Leonore No. 2</i> was rewritten because
certain passages given to the wood-wind troubled the players. Others say
it was too difficult for the strings and too long. In <i>No. 2</i>, as well as in
<i>No. 3</i>, the chief dramatic stroke is the trumpet signal, which announces
the arrival of the Minister of Justice, confounds Pizarro, and saves
Florestan and Leonore.</p>
<p>The <i>Fidelio</i> overture is the one generally played before performances
of the opera in Germany, although Weingartner has tried earnestly to
restore <i>Leonore No. 2</i> to that position. <i>Leonore No. 3</i> is sometimes
played between the acts of the opera. The objection to this is that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
trumpet episode of the prison will then discount the dramatic ending of
the overture when it comes in the following act, nor does the joyous ending
of the overture prepare the hearer for the lugubrious scene with the
Florestan soliloquy. B&uuml;low therefore performed the overture at the
end of the opera. Zumpe did likewise in Munich. They argued with
Wagner that this overture is the quintessence of the opera, &ldquo;the complete
and definite synthesis of the drama that Beethoven had dreamed
of writing.&rdquo; There has been a tradition that the overture should be
played between the scenes of the second act.</p>
<p>The key of the <i>Leonore Overture No. 3</i> is C major. A short <i>fortissimo</i>
is struck. It is diminished by wood-wind and horns, then taken up,
<i>piano</i>, by the strings. From this G there is a descent down the scale of
C major to a mysterious F sharp. The key of B minor is reached, finally
A flat major, when the opening measures of Florenstan&rsquo;s air, &ldquo;In des
Lebens Fr&uuml;lingstagen&rdquo; (Act II of the opera), is played. The theme
of the <i>allegro</i>, C major, begins <i>pianissimo</i>, first violins and violoncellos,
and waxes impetuously. The second theme has been described
as &ldquo;woven out of sobs and pitying sighs.&rdquo; The working out consists
in alternating a pathetic figure, taken from the second theme and
played by the wood-wind over a nervous string accompaniment, with
furious outbursts from the whole orchestra. Then comes the trumpet call
off stage. The twice-repeated call is answered in each instance by the
short song of thanksgiving from the same scene. Leonore&rsquo;s words are:
&ldquo;<i>Ach! du bist gerettet! Grosser Gott!</i>&rdquo; A gradual transition leads from
this to the return of the first theme at the beginning of the third part
(flute solo). The third part is developed in general as the first part and
leads to a wildly jubilant <i>coda</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO &ldquo;EGMONT,&rdquo; OP. 84</span></h2>
<p>Strange things have been done by conductors to Beethoven&rsquo;s
overture. We remember Franz W&uuml;llner in Berlin slackening the
pace in the <i>allegro</i> section when he came to the heavy chords that
are supposed by some commentators, finders of sunbeams in cucumbers,
to represent Alva, and then playing the chords with
brutal emphasis and a long pause between them. Another conductor,
no less a person than Arthur Nikisch, made a long hold
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
on the short, incisive violin stroke just before the <i>coda</i>, and then
brought the figure slowly down <i>portamento</i>. We doubt if he did
this in later years.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This overture was composed in 1810; it was published in 1811. The
music to Goethe&rsquo;s play&mdash;overture, four entr&rsquo;actes, two songs sung by
Cl&auml;rchen, &ldquo;Cl&auml;rchen&rsquo;s Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Melodrama,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Triumph Symphony&rdquo;
(identical with the coda of the overture), for the end of the play, nine
numbers in all&mdash;was performed for the first time with the tragedy at
the Hofburg Theater, Vienna, May 24, 1810. Antonie Adamberger was
the Cl&auml;rchen.</p>
<p>When Hartl took the management of the two Vienna Court theaters,
January 1, 1808, he produced plays by Schiller. He finally determined
to produce plays by Goethe and Schiller with music, and he chose
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Tell</i> and Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Egmont</i>. Beethoven and Gyrowetz were
asked to write the music. The former was anxious to compose the music
for <i>Tell</i>; but, as Czerny tells the story, there were intrigues, and, as
<i>Egmont</i> was thought to be less suggestive to a composer, the music for
that play was assigned to Beethoven. Gyrowetz&rsquo;s music to <i>Tell</i> was
performed June 14, 1810. It was described by a correspondent of a
Leipsic journal of music as &ldquo;characteristic and written with intelligence.&rdquo;
No allusion was made at the time anywhere to Beethoven&rsquo;s
<i>Egmont</i>.</p>
<p>The overture has a short, slow introduction, <i>sostenuto ma non troppo</i>,
F minor, 3-2. The main body of the overture is an <i>allegro</i>, F minor,
3-4. The first theme is in the strings; each phrase is a descending
<i>arpeggio</i> in the violoncellos, closing with a sigh in the first violins; the
antithesis begins with a &ldquo;sort of sigh&rdquo; in the wood-wind, then in the
strings; then there is a development into passage work. The second
theme has for its thesis a version of the first two measures of the
sarabande theme of the introduction, <i>fortissimo</i> (strings), in A flat
major, and the antithesis is a triplet in the wood-wind. The coda,
<i>allegro con brio</i>, F major, 4-4, begins <i>pianissimo</i>. The full orchestra
at last has a brilliant fanfare figure, which ends in a shouting climax,
with a famous shrillness of the piccolo against fanfares of bassoons and
brass and between crashes of the full orchestra.</p>
<p>Long and curious commentaries have been written in explanation of
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
this overture. As though the masterpiece needed an explanation! We
remember one in which a subtle meaning was given to at least every
half-dozen measures: The Netherlanders are under the crushing weight
of Spanish oppression; Egmont is melancholy, his blood is stagnant,
but at last he shakes off his melancholy (violins), answers the cries of
his country-people, rouses himself for action; his death is portrayed
by a descent of the violins from C to G; but his countrymen triumph.
Spain is typified by the sarabande movement; the heavy, recurring
chords portray the lean-bodied, lean-visaged Duke of Alva; &ldquo;the violin
theme in D flat, to which the clarinet brings the under-third, is a
picture of Cl&auml;rchen,&rdquo; etc. One might as well illustrate word for word
the solemn ending of Thomas Fuller&rsquo;s life of Alva in <i>The Profane
State</i>: &ldquo;But as his life was a mirror of cruelty, so was his death of
God&rsquo;s patience. It was admirable that his tragical acts should have a
comical end; that he that sent so many to the grave should go to his
own, and die in peace. But God&rsquo;s justice on offenders goes not always
in the same path, nor the same pace; and he is not pardoned for
the fault who is for a while reprieved from the punishment; yea, sometimes
the guest in the inn goes quietly to bed before the reckoning
for his supper is brought to him to discharge.&rdquo; The overture is at
first a mighty lamentation. There are voices of an aroused and angry
people, and there is at the last tumultuous rejoicing. The &ldquo;Triumph
Symphony&rdquo; at the end of the play forms the end of the overture.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO &ldquo;CORIOLANUS,&rdquo; OP. 62</span></h2>
<p>Someone said&mdash;was it A. W. Thayer?&mdash;of this overture that he
could not understand it&mdash;until he read Collin&rsquo;s tragedy; that he
could not reconcile the music with Shakespeare&rsquo;s text. Pray, what
would the gentleman have had? It is immaterial whether Beethoven
had Collin or Shakespeare in mind. The name Coriolanus
was enough, even if he knew it only from some schoolboy
history of Rome; for in this music we hear the proud voice, we
hear the haughty, inexorable bearing of the soldier-patrician. Nor
does it matter whether the lyrical theme is the entreating voice
of wife or mother. Possibly if one should read Collin&rsquo;s play he
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
would wonder that Beethoven should have written an overture for
it. There it is&mdash;one of Beethoven&rsquo;s greatest works. From his own
disdain of the mob, from his own contempt of what the public
thought of his music, he recognizes in Coriolanus a kindred spirit.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The original manuscript of the overture bears this inscription:
<i>Overtura</i> (<i>zum Trauerspiel Coriolan</i>) <i>composta da L. v. Beethoven,
1807</i>. The words in parentheses are crossed out. The overture was published
in 1808. The tragedy by Heinrich Joseph von Collin, in which
the hero kills himself, was produced in Vienna on November 24, 1802.
Collin (1771-1811) was jurist and poet. In 1803 he was ennobled. In
1809 he became court councillor. Other tragedies by him were <i>Regulus</i>
and <i>Polyxena</i>. In 1807 Beethoven was expecting a libretto from him.
Collin tried <i>Macbeth</i>, Tasso&rsquo;s <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>, and a <i>Bradamante</i> to
which J. F. Reichardt set music. But Beethoven wrote to Collin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great irate poet, give up Reichardt. Take my <i>music</i> for your
<i>poetry</i>; I promise that you will not thereby suffer. As soon as my concert
is over ... I will come to you, and then we will at once take in
hand the opera&mdash;and it shall soon sound. For the rest you can ring
out your just complaints about me by word of mouth.&rdquo; The libretto
before this had seemed to Beethoven &ldquo;too venturesome&rdquo; in respect
of its use of the supernatural. Collin&rsquo;s biographer, Laban, says that
the <i>Macbeth</i> libretto was left unfinished in the middle of the second
act &ldquo;because it threatened to become too gloomy.&rdquo; At various times
Beethoven thought of Grillparzer&rsquo;s <i>Melusine</i>, K&ouml;rner&rsquo;s <i>Return of
Ulysses</i>, Treitschke&rsquo;s <i>Romulus and Remus</i>, Berger&rsquo;s <i>Bacchus</i>, Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Fiesco</i>, Grillparzer&rsquo;s <i>Dragomira</i>,
Voltaire&rsquo;s tragedies, and Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, as operatic subjects. He told
Rellstab that the material must be attractive to him; that it must be
something he could take up with sincerity and love. &ldquo;I could not compose
operas like <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>Figaro</i>. They are repugnant to me. I
could not have chosen such subjects; they are too frivolous for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is in one movement, <i>allegro con brio</i>, in C minor, 4-4, as written,
<i>alla breve</i> as played. It begins with a succession of three long-held <i>fortissimo</i>
C&rsquo;s in the strings, each one of which is followed by a resounding
chord in the full orchestra. The agitated first theme in C minor soon
gives place to the second lyrically passionate theme in E flat major.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
The development of this theme is also short. The free fantasia is
practically passage-work on the conclusion theme. The tendency to
shorten the academic sonata form is seen also in the third part, or
recapitulation. The first theme returns in F minor with curtailed development.
The second theme is now in C major. The <i>coda</i> begins
with this theme; passage-work follows; there is a repetition of the C&rsquo;s
and the chords of the beginning; and the purely dramatic close in C
minor may be suggestive of the hero&rsquo;s death.</p>

<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Andante con moto</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Rondo: vivace</dd></dl>
<p>This concerto was probably composed for the most part, and it was
surely completed, in 1806, although Schindler, on advice from Ries,
named 1804 as the year, and an edition of the concerto published by
Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel states that the year 1805 saw the completion.</p>
<p>The concerto was performed by Beethoven in one of two private
subscription concerts of his works given in the dwelling house of
Prince Lobkowitz, Vienna, in March, 1807. The first public performance
was in the Theater an der Wien, Vienna, December 22, 1808.</p>
<p>The score was dedicated &ldquo;humbly&rdquo; by Beethoven to &ldquo;his Imperial
Highness, the Archduke Rudolph of Austria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro moderato</i>, G major, 4-4. The first movement, contrary to
the tradition that prevailed at the time, begins with the pianoforte
alone. The pianoforte announces the first four measures of the first
theme, five measures if an introductory chord be counted. (These
measures are to be found in a sketchbook of Beethoven which is
dated 1803, but in this book they end in the tonic, and not in the
dominant.) The orchestra then enters in B major, but soon returns to G
major, and develops the theme, until after a short climax with a
modulation a second theme appears, which is given to the first violins.
There is a third theme <i>fortissimo</i> in G major, with a supplement for
the wood-wind instruments, and still another new theme, an expressive
melody in B flat major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>II. <i>Andante con moto</i>, E minor, 2-4. This movement is free in form.
Beethoven put a footnote in the full score to this effect: &ldquo;During the
whole <i>andante</i>, the pianist must use the soft pedal (<i>una corda</i>) unintermittently;
the sign &lsquo;Ped&rsquo; refers to the occasional use of the ordinary
pedal.&rdquo; This footnote is contradicted at one point in the score by the
marking &ldquo;<i>tre corde</i>&rdquo; for five measures near the end of the movement. A
stern and powerful recitative for strings alternates with gentle and
melodic passages for the pianoforte. &ldquo;The strings of the orchestra keep
repeating a forbidding figure of strongly marked rhythm in <i>staccato</i>
octaves; this figure continues at intervals in stern, unchanging <i>forte</i>
through about half the movement and then gradually dies away. In the
intervals of this harsh theme the pianoforte as it were improvises little
scraps of the tenderest, sweetest harmony and melody, rising for a
moment into the wildest frenzied exultation after its enemy, the
orchestra, has been silenced by its soft pleading, then falling back into
hushed sadness as the orchestra comes in once more with a whispered
recollection of its once so cruel phrase; saying as plainly as an orchestra
can say it, &lsquo;The rest is silence!&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>III. <i>Rondo</i>: <i>vivace</i>. The first theme, of a sunny and gay character,
is announced immediately by the strings. The pianoforte follows with
a variation. A short but more melodic phrase for the strings is also taken
up by the pianoforte. A third theme, of a bolder character, is announced
by the orchestra. The fourth theme is given to the pianoforte. The
<i>rondo</i>, &ldquo;of a reckless, devil-may-care spirit in its jollity,&rdquo; is based on this
thematic material. At the end the tempo becomes <i>presto</i>.</p>

<p>There are noble pages, also moments of tenderness, in the first
movement; there is a majestic, compelling sweep. In the second
movement there is simplicity, serenity of contemplation, Buddhistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
music of singular detachment, found only in certain measures of
Beethoven and Handel; but the <i>finale</i> with the endless repetitions
of a Kangaroo theme leads one to long for the end.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Beethoven, having made some sketches in 1808, wrote this concerto
in 1809 at Vienna. The town was occupied by the French from
May 12 to October 14.</p>
<p>It is said that the first public performance of which there is any
record was at Leipsic on November 28, 1811. It is also stated that this
performance was late in 1810. The pianist was Friedrich Schneider.
The <i>Allgemeine Musik Zeitung</i> described the concerto as &ldquo;without
doubt one of the most original, imaginative, effective, but most difficult
of all existing concertos.&rdquo; Schneider, it seems, played &ldquo;with soul&rdquo; as
well as force, and the orchestra accompanied remarkably, for &ldquo;it
respected and admired composer, composition, and pianist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first performance with which Beethoven was concerned was at
Vienna on February 12, 1812, when Karl Czerny (1791-1857) was
the pianist. The occasion was a singular sort of entertainment. Theodor
K&ouml;rner, who had been a looker-on in Vienna only for a short time,
wrote home on February 15: &ldquo;Wednesday there took place for the
benefit of the Charitable Society of Noble Ladies a concert and a
representation of three pictures after Raphael, Poussin, and Troyes, as
Goethe describes them in his <i>Elective Affinities</i>. A new concerto by
Beethoven for the pianoforte did not succeed&rdquo;; but Castelli&rsquo;s <i>Thalia</i>
gave as the reason of this failure the unwillingness of Beethoven, &ldquo;full
of proud self-confidence,&rdquo; to write for the crowd. &ldquo;He can be understood
and appreciated only by the connoisseurs, and one cannot reckon
on their being in a majority at such an affair.&rdquo; Thayer moralizes on
this statement. &ldquo;The trills of Miss Sessi and Mr. Siboni and Mayseder&rsquo;s
Variations on the March from <i>Aline</i> were appropriate to the occasion
and the audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vienna correspondent of the <i>Allgemeine Musik Zeitung</i> wrote
that the extravagant length of the concerto diminished the total effect
which the &ldquo;noble production of the mind&rdquo; would otherwise have
made. As for Czerny, &ldquo;he played with much accuracy and fluency, and
showed that he has it in his power to conquer the greatest difficulties.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
But the correspondent wished that there had been greater purity in
his performance, a finer contour.</p>
<p>The tableaux pleased mightily, and each one was repeated.</p>
<p class="tb">The first movement, <i>allegro</i>, in E flat, 4-4, opens with a strong chord
for full orchestra, which is followed by a <i>cadenza</i> for the solo instrument.</p>
<p>The first theme is given out by the strings and afterward taken up
by the clarinets. The second theme soon follows, first in E flat minor,
softly and staccato by the strings, then <i>legato</i> and in E flat major by
the horns. It was usual at that time for the pianist to extemporize his
<i>cadenza</i>, but Beethoven inserted his own with the remark, &ldquo;<i>non si fa,
una cadenza ma s&rsquo;attacca subito il seguente</i>&rdquo; (that is to say, &ldquo;Do not
insert a <i>cadenza</i>, but attack the following immediately&rdquo;); and he then
went so far as to accompany with the orchestra the latter portion of
his <i>cadenza</i>.</p>
<p>The second movement, <i>adagio un poco moto</i>, in B major, 2-2, is
in the form of &ldquo;quasi-variations,&rdquo; developed chiefly from the theme
given at the beginning by muted strings. This movement goes, with a
suggestion hinted by the pianoforte of the coming first theme of the
<i>rondo</i>, into the <i>rondo</i>, the <i>finale</i>, <i>allegro</i>, in E flat, 6-8. Both the themes
are announced by the pianoforte and developed elaborately. The end
of the <i>coda</i> is distinguished by a descending long series of pianoforte
chords which steadily diminish in force, while the kettledrums keep
marking the rhythm of the opening theme.</p>

<p>Beethoven composed this concerto in 1806 for the violinist, Franz
Clement, who played it for the first time at the latter&rsquo;s concert in the
Theater an der Wien, December 23 of that year.</p>
<p>Beethoven, often behindhand in finishing compositions for solo
players&mdash;according to the testimony of Dr. Bartolini and others&mdash;did
not have the concerto ready for rehearsal. Clement played it at
the concert <i>a vista</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>The first movement, <i>allegro ma non troppo</i>, in D major, 4-4, begins
with a long orchestral <i>ritornello</i>. The first theme is announced by oboes,
clarinets, and bassoons. It is introduced by four taps of the kettledrums
on D. (There is a story that these tones were suggested to the composer
by his hearing a neighbor knocking at the door of his house for
admission late at night.) The wind instruments go on with the second
phrase. Then come the famous and problematical four D sharps in the
first violins. The short second theme is given out by wood-wind and
horns in D major, repeated in D minor, and developed at length. The
solo violin enters after a half cadence on the dominant. The first
part of the movement is repeated. The solo violin plays the themes or
embroiders them. The working out is long and elaborate. A <i>cadenza</i>
is introduced at the climax of the conclusion theme. There is a short
<i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>The second movement, <i>Larghetto</i>, in G major, 4-4, is a romance in
free form. The accompaniment is lightly scored. The theme is almost
wholly confined to the orchestra, while the solo violin embroiders with
elaborate figuration until the end, when it brings in the theme, but soon
abandons it to continue the embroidery. A <i>cadenza</i> leads to the <i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>The third movement, <i>rondo</i>, in D major, 6-8, is based on a theme
that has the character of a folk dance. The second theme is a sort
of hunting call for the horns. There is place for the insertion of a free
<i>cadenza</i> near the end.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s great development of the symphony was in his use of the instruments&mdash;not
in their number. For the most part, he called for virtually the same
orchestra which his predecessors, Mozart and Haydn, evolved: two flutes, two oboes,
two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, kettledrums and strings. This
applies to Beethoven&rsquo;s First, Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Eighth symphonies
(exceptions: the addition of a third horn in the <i>Eroica</i> symphony, and use
of a single flute in the Fourth).</p>
<p>In the Fifth symphony, he gave greater sonority to his <i>finale</i> with three trombones,
double bassoon, and piccolo.</p>
<p>In the Sixth, he added a piccolo for the storm, two trombones for the storm and
<i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>In the Ninth, he increased his horns to four, added three trombones, and the
following instruments in the <i>alla marcia</i> of the <i>finale</i>: piccolo, double bassoon,
cymbals, triangle, and bass drum.</p>
<p>In the overtures here listed, Beethoven added to the above essential orchestration
as follows: <i>Egmont</i>&mdash;two additional horns, piccolo; <i>Leonore</i>&mdash;two additional
horns and three trombones. The concertos call for the minimum orchestration, &ldquo;in
twos.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">HECTOR</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BERLIOZ</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at La C&ocirc;te Saint-Andr&eacute;, December 11, 1803; died at Paris, March 9, 1869)</p>
<p>The more Berlioz is studied, the more the wonder grows at his
colossal originality. Yet there are some who still insist that he had
little melodic invention. They have ears, and they do not hear.
They should read the essay of Romain Rolland, and the essay of
Felix Weingartner in his <i>Akkorde</i>, for there are many, unfortunately,
who do not trust their own judgment and are eager to
accept the sayings of others who are considered men of authority.</p>
<p>Berlioz wrote his <i>Fantastic</i> symphony in a high-strung, hotly
romantic period. Romanticism was in the air. Much that seems
fantastic to us, living in a commercial and material period, was
natural then. It was as natural to be extravagant in belief, theories,
speech, manner of life, dress, as it was to breathe. And Berlioz
was a revolutionary of revolutionaries. His &ldquo;antediluvian hair&rdquo;
that rose from his forehead was as much of a symbol as was the
flaming waistcoat worn by Th&eacute;ophile on the memorable first night
of <i>Hernani</i>. We smile now at the eccentricities and the extravagancies
of the period, but we owe the perpetrators a heavy debt
of gratitude. They made the art of today possible.</p>
<p>It is easy to call Berlioz a <i>poseur</i>, but the young man was terribly
in earnest. He put his own love tragedy into his <i>Fantastic</i>
symphony; he was a man; he suffered; he was there; and so the
music did not pass away with the outward badges of romanticism,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
with much of Byron&rsquo;s poetry, with plays and novels of the time.
The emotions he expressed are still universal and elemental.</p>

<p>When one remembers that Beethoven had died only a few years
before Berlioz wrote his symphony; that Schubert also had died;
that Schumann and Wagner were not known as composers, one
must regard this audacious work of Berlioz as nothing less than
marvelous. No predecessor had given him hints for orchestration:
he invented his own system; he thought and wrote orchestrally.
Liszt, Meyerbeer, Wagner, Strauss, the Russian School, in fact, the
musical world of the last century is indebted deeply to Hector
Berlioz. Without him all would have been sadly at a loss.</p>
<p>One may smile in this matter-of-fact age at the frantic love of
Berlioz for the Irish actress; at the programme of the <i>Fantastic</i>
symphony, written when he was not twenty-seven years old. But
there&rsquo;s no denying the genius in this work, the genius that has
kept this music alive in spite of a few cheap or arid pages; for
there is the imagination, the poetic sensitiveness that we rightly
associate with genius. If one would gladly shorten the &ldquo;Scene in
the Fields,&rdquo; what is to be said against that masterpiece &ldquo;The March
to the Scaffold,&rdquo; with its haunting, nightmarish rhythm, its ghostly
chatter of the bassoons, its mocking shouts of brass? Or who does
not find beauty in the first movement, brilliance in the second, and
a demoniacal spirit in the <i>finale</i>?</p>
<p>Ernest Newman has wisely said that the harmonies of Berlioz
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
suited exactly his aims; that however strange they may seem on
paper, they are justified when they are heard. As for the charge of
failure as a melodist, there are the songs; there is the pathetic air
of Marguerite in <i>The Damnation of Faust</i>, the &ldquo;Farewell of the
Shepherds&rdquo; in <i>The Childhood of Christ</i>, the grand arias in <i>Les
Troyens</i>.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony forms the first part of a work entitled <i>&Eacute;pisode de
la vie d&rsquo;un artiste</i> (Episode in the Life of an Artist), the second part
of which is a lyric monodrama, <i>L&eacute;lio, ou le retour &agrave; la vie</i> (Lelio; or,
The Return to Life). Berlioz published the following preface to the
full score of the symphony:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;PROGRAMME OF THE SYMPHONY</h3>
<p>&ldquo;A young musician of morbid sensibility and ardent imagination
poisons himself with opium in a fit of amorous despair. The narcotic
dose, too weak to result in death, plunges him into a heavy sleep accompanied
by the strangest visions, during which his sensations, sentiments,
and recollections are translated in his sick brain into musical
thoughts and images. The beloved woman herself has become for
him a melody, like a fixed idea which he finds and hears everywhere.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Part I</span>
<br />&ldquo;<span class="small">DREAMS, PASSIONS</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;He first recalls that uneasiness of soul, that <i>vague des passions</i>, those
moments of causeless melancholy and joy, which he experienced before
seeing her whom he loves; then the volcanic love with which she suddenly
inspired him, his moments of delirious anguish, of jealous fury,
his returns to loving tenderness, and his religious consolations.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Part II</span>
<br />&ldquo;<span class="small">A BALL</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;He sees his beloved at a ball, in the midst of the tumult of a brilliant
f&ecirc;te.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Part III</span>
<br />&ldquo;<span class="small">SCENE IN THE FIELDS</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;One summer evening in the country he hears two shepherds playing
a <i>Ranz-des-vaches</i> in alternate dialogue; this pastoral duet, the scene
around him, the light rustling of the trees gently swayed by the breeze,
some hopes he has recently conceived, all combine to restore an unwonted
calm to his heart and to impart a more cheerful coloring to his
thoughts; but <i>she</i> appears once more, his heart stops beating, he is
agitated with painful presentiments; if she were to betray him!...
One of the shepherds resumes his artless melody, the other no longer
answers him. The sun sets ... the sound of distant thunder ...
solitude ... silence.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Part IV</span>
<br />&ldquo;<span class="small">MARCH TO THE SCAFFOLD</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;He dreams that he has killed his beloved, that he is condemned to
death and led to execution. The procession advances to the tones of a
march which is now sombre and wild, now brilliant and solemn, in
which the dull sound of the tread of heavy feet follows without transition
upon the most resounding outburst. At the end, the <i>fixed idea</i> reappears
for an instant, like a last love-thought interrupted by the fatal
stroke.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Part V</span>
<br />&ldquo;<span class="small">WALPURGISNIGHT&rsquo;S DREAM</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;He sees himself at the witches&rsquo; Sabbath, in the midst of a frightful
group of ghosts, magicians, and monsters of all sorts, who have come
together for his obsequies. He hears strange noises, groans, ringing
laughter, shrieks to which other shrieks seem to reply. The <i>beloved
melody</i> again reappears; but it has lost its noble and timid character;
it has become an ignoble, trivial, and grotesque dance tune; it is <i>she</i>
who comes to the witches&rsquo; Sabbath.... Howlings of joy at her
arrival ... she takes part in the diabolic orgy.... Funeral knells,
burlesque parody on the <i>Dies Ir&aelig;</i>. Witches&rsquo; dance. The Witches&rsquo; dance
and the <i>Dies Ir&aelig;</i> together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In a preamble to this programme, relating mostly to some details of
stage-setting when the <i>&Eacute;pisode de la vie d&rsquo;un artiste</i> is given entire,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
Berlioz also writes: &ldquo;If the symphony is played separately at a concert
... the programme does not absolutely need to be distributed among
the audience, and only the titles of the five movements need be printed,
as the symphony can offer by itself (the composer hopes) a musical
interest independent of all dramatic intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The score is dedicated to Nicholas I of Russia.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The symphony begins with a slow introduction, <i>Largo</i>, C minor, 4-4.
Two measures of soft preluding lead to a plaintive theme played by the
strings, <i>pianissimo</i>. This theme is a melody of romance composed by
Berlioz in his youth and recurs in modified form in each movement.
&ldquo;Strange to say,&rdquo; wrote Berlioz of the imagined artist, &ldquo;the image of
the loved one never comes into his mind without the accompaniment of
a musical thought in which he finds the characteristic grace and nobility
attributed by him to his beloved. This double <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>&mdash;obsessing
idea&mdash;constantly pursues him; hence the constant apparition in all the
movements of the chief melody of the first <i>allegro</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony is scored for two flutes (and piccolo), two oboes (and
English horn), two clarinets and E flat clarinet, four bassoons, four
horns, two cornets-&agrave;-pistons, two trumpets, three trombones, two tubas,
two pairs of kettledrums (three players) bells, snaredrum, bass drum,
cymbals, two harps, and strings.</p>
<p>What was the origin of this symphony? Who was the woman that
inspired the music and was so bitterly assailed in the argument sent to
his friend Ferrand? Boschot describes her as she looked in 1827: &ldquo;Tall,
lithe, with shoulders rather fat and with full bust, a supple figure, a face
of an astonishing whiteness, with bulging eyes like those of the glowing
Mme de Sta&euml;l, but eyes gentle, dreamy, and sometimes sparkling with
passion. And this Harriet Smithson had the most beautiful arms&mdash;bulbous
flesh, sinuous line. They had the effect on a man of a caress
of a flower. And the voice of Harriet Smithson was music.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Harriet Constance Smithson, known in Paris as Henrietta Smithson,
born at Ennis, Ireland, March 18, 1800, was seen as Ophelia by Berlioz
at the Od&eacute;on, Paris, September 11, 1827, after engagements in Ireland
and England. She appeared there first on September 6 with Kemble,
Powers, and Liston. Her success was immediate and overwhelming.
She appeared as Juliet, September 15 of the same year. Berlioz
saw these first performances. He did not then know a word of English:
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Shakespeare was revealed to him only through the mist of Letourneur&rsquo;s
translation. After the third act of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> he could scarcely
breathe; he suffered as though &ldquo;an iron hand was clutching&rdquo; his heart,
and he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am lost.&rdquo; And the story still survives, in spite of
Berlioz&rsquo;s denial, that he then exclaimed: &ldquo;That woman shall be my
wife! And on that drama I shall write my greatest symphony.&rdquo; He
married her, and he was thereafter miserable. He wrote the <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> symphony. To the end he preferred the &ldquo;Love Scene&rdquo; to all his
other music.</p>
<p>Berlioz has told in his Memoirs the story of his wooing. He was
madly in love. After a tour in Holland, Miss Smithson went back to
London, but Berlioz saw her always by his side; she was his obsessing
idea, the inspiring muse. When he learned through the journals of her
triumphs in London in June, 1829, he dreamed of composing a great
work, the <i>Episode in the Life of an Artist</i>, to triumph by her side and
through her. He wrote Ferrand, February 6, 1830: &ldquo;I am again plunged
in the anguish of an interminable and inextinguishable passion, without
motive, without cause. She is always at London, and yet I think I feel
her near me: all my remembrances awake and unite to wound me; I
hear my heart beating, and its pulsations shake me as the piston
strokes of a steam engine. Each muscle of my body shudders with
pain. In vain! &rsquo;Tis terrible! O unhappy one! if she could for one moment
conceive all the poetry, all the infinity of a like love, she would fly to
my arms, were she to die through my embrace. I was on the point of
beginning my great symphony (<i>Episode in the Life of an Artist</i>), in
which the development of my infernal passion is to be portrayed; I
have it all in my head, but I cannot write anything. Let us wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote Ferrand on April 16, 1830: &ldquo;Since my last I have experienced
terrible hurricanes, and my vessel has cracked and groaned
horribly, but at last it has righted itself; it now sails tolerably well.
Frightful truths, discovered and indisputable, have started my cure; and
I think that it will be as complete as my tenacious nature will permit.
I am about to confirm my resolution by a work which satisfies me
completely.&rdquo; He then inserted a description of the work. &ldquo;Behold, my
dear friend, the scheme of this immense symphony. I am just writing
the last note of it. If I can be ready on Whitsunday, May 30, I shall
give a concert at the Nouveaut&eacute;s, with an orchestra of two hundred
and twenty players. I am afraid I shall not have the copied parts ready.
Just now I am stupid; the frightful effort of thought necessary to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
production of my work has tired my imagination, and I should like to
sleep and rest continually. But if the brain sleeps, the heart keeps
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote to Ferrand on May 13, 1830: &ldquo;I think that you will be
satisfied with the scheme of my <i>Fantastic</i> symphony which I sent you
in my letter. The vengeance is not too great; besides, I did not
write the <i>Dream of a Sabbat Night</i> in this spirit. I do not wish to
avenge myself. I pity her and I despise her. She&rsquo;s an ordinary woman,
endowed with an instinctive genius for expressing the lacerations of
the human soul, but she has never felt them, and she is incapable of
conceiving an immense and noble sentiment, as that with which I
honored her. I make today my last arrangements with the managers
of the Nouveaut&eacute;s for my concert the 30th of this month. They are
very honest fellows and very accommodating. We shall begin to rehearse
the <i>Fantastic</i> symphony in three days; all the parts have been
copied with the greatest care; there are 2,300 pages of music; nearly 400
francs for the copying. We hope to have decent receipts on Whitsunday,
for all the theaters will be closed.... I hope that the wretched woman
will be there that day; at any rate, there are many conspiring at the
Feydeau to make her go. I do not believe it, however; she will surely
recognize herself in reading the programme of my instrumental drama,
and then she will take good care not to appear. Well, God knows all
that will be said, there are so many who know my story!&rdquo; He hoped to
have the assistance of the &ldquo;incredible tenor,&rdquo; Haizinger, and of Schr&ouml;der-Devrient,
who were then singing in opera at the Salle Favart.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;frightful truths&rdquo; about Miss Smithson were sheer calumnies.
Berlioz made her tardy reparation in the extraordinary letter written
to Ferrand, October 11, 1833, shortly after his marriage. He too had
been slandered: her friends had told her that he was an epileptic, that
he was mad. As soon as he heard the slanders, he raged, he disappeared
for two days, and wandered over lonely plains outside Paris, and at
last slept, worn out with hunger and fatigue, in a field near Sceaux.
His friends had searched Paris for him, even the morgue. After his
return he was obstinately silent for several days.</p>
<p>At last Berlioz determined to give a grand concert at which his cantata
<i>Sardanapale</i>, which took the prix de Rome, and the <i>Fantastic</i> symphony
would be performed. Furthermore, Miss Smithson was then in Paris.
The concert was announced for November 14, 1830, but it was postponed
till December 5 of that year. But Miss Smithson was not present;
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
she was at the Op&eacute;ra at a performance for her benefit, and she mimed
there for the first and last time the part of Fenella in Auber&rsquo;s <i>Muette
de Portici</i>. The symphony made a sensation; it was attacked and defended
violently, and Cherubini answered, when he was asked if he
heard it: &ldquo;<i>Ze n&rsquo;ai pas besoin d&rsquo;aller savoir comment il n&eacute; faut pas faire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Berlioz returned from Italy, he purposed to give a concert.
He learned accidentally that Miss Smithson was still in Paris; but she
had no thought of her old adorer; after professional disappointments
in London, due perhaps to her Irish accent, she returned to Paris in
the hope of establishing an English theater. The public in Paris knew
her no more; she was poor and at her wit&rsquo;s end. Invited to go to a
concert, she took a carriage, and then, looking over the programme,
she read the argument of the <i>Fantastic</i> symphony which with <i>L&eacute;lio</i>,
its supplement, was performed on December 9, 1832. Fortunately, Berlioz
had revised the programme and omitted the coarse insult (&ldquo;She is
now only a courtesan worthy to figure in such an orgy&rdquo;) in the programme
of the <i>Sabbat</i>; but, as soon as she was seen in the hall of
the Conservatory, some who knew Berlioz&rsquo;s original purpose chuckled,
and spread malicious information. Miss Smithson, moved by the
thought that her adorer, as the hero of the symphony, tried to poison
himself for her, accepted the symphony as a flattering tribute.</p>
<p>Tiersot<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> describes the scene at this second performance in 1832. The
pit was crowded, as on the great days of romantic festival occasions&mdash;Dumas&rsquo;s
<i>Antony</i> was then jamming the Porte Saint-Martin&mdash;with pale,
long-haired youths, who believed firmly that &ldquo;to make art&rdquo; was the only
worthy occupation on the earth; they had strange, fierce countenances,
curled mustaches, Merovingian hair or hair cut brushlike, extravagant
doublets, velvet-faced coats thrown back on the shoulders. The women
were dressed in the height of the prevailing fashion, with coiffures <i>&agrave; la
girafe</i>, high shell combs, shoulder-of-mutton sleeves, and short petticoats
that revealed buskins. Berlioz was seated behind the drums, and his
&ldquo;monstrous antediluvian hair rose from his forehead as a primeval
forest on a steep cliff.&rdquo; Heine was in the hall. He was especially impressed
by the <i>Sabbat</i>, &ldquo;where the Devil sings the mass, where the
music of the Catholic church is parodied with the most horrible, the
most outrageous buffoonery. It is a farce in which all the serpents that
we carry hidden in the heart raise their heads, hissing with pleasure
and biting their tails in the transport of their joy.... Mme Smithson
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
was there, whom the French actresses have imitated so closely.
M. Berlioz was madly in love with this woman for three years, and it is
to this passion that we owe the savage symphony which we hear today.&rdquo;
It is said that, each time Berlioz met her eyes, he beat the drums
with redoubled fury. Heine added: &ldquo;Since then Miss Smithson has
become Mme Berlioz, and her husband has cut his hair. When I heard
the symphony again last winter, I saw him still at the back of the orchestra,
in his place near the drums. The beautiful Englishwoman was
in a stage box, and their eyes again met: but he no longer beat with
such rage on his drums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Musician and play actress met, and after mutual distrust and recrimination
there was mutual love. She was poor and in debt; on March 16,
1833, she broke her leg, and her stage career was over. Berlioz pressed
her to marry him; both families objected; there were violent scenes;
Berlioz tried to poison himself before her eyes; Miss Smithson at last
gave way, and the marriage was celebrated on October 3, 1833. It was
an unhappy one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A separation became inevitable,&rdquo; says Legouv&eacute;.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> &ldquo;She who had been
Mlle Smithson, grown old and ungainly before her time, and ill besides,
retired to a humble lodging at Montmartre, where Berlioz,
notwithstanding his poverty, faithfully and decently provided for her.
He went to see her as a friend, for he had never ceased to love her,
he loved her as much as ever; but he loved her differently, and that
difference had produced a chasm between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some years of acute physical as well as mental suffering, the
once famous play actress died, March 3, 1854. Berlioz put two wreaths
on her grave, one for him and one for their absent son, the sailor. And
Jules Janin sang her requiem in a memorable <i>feuilleton</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE, &ldquo;THE ROMAN CARNIVAL,&rdquo; OP. 9</span></h2>
<p>Berlioz&rsquo;s overture, <i>Le Carnaval Romain</i>, originally intended as an
introduction to the second act of <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i>, is dedicated to
Prince de Hohenzollern-Hechingen. It was performed for the first time,
and under the direction of the composer, at the Salle Herz, Paris, on
February 3, 1844. The overture was composed in Paris in 1843, shortly
after a journey in Germany. The score and parts were published in
June, 1844.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The chief thematic material of the overture was taken by Berlioz
from his opera <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i>, originally in two acts, libretto by
L&eacute;on de Wailly and Augusta Barbier. It was produced at the Op&eacute;ra,
Paris, on September 10, 1838.</p>
<p>The success of <i>The Roman Carnival</i> overture was immediate. The
applause was so long-continued that the work was repeated then and
there. Berlioz gives an account of the performance in the forty-eighth
chapter of his Memoirs. He first says that Habeneck, the conductor at
the Op&eacute;ra, would not take the time of the <i>saltarello</i> fast enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years afterwards, when I had written the overture <i>The Roman
Carnival</i>, in which the theme of the <i>allegro</i> is the same <i>saltarello</i> which
he never could make go, Habeneck was in the foyer of the Salle Herz
the evening that this overture was to be played for the first time. He
had heard that we had rehearsed it without wind instruments, for
some of my players, in the service of the National Guard, had been
called away. &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;There will surely be some catastrophe at
this concert, and I must be there to see it!&rsquo; When I arrived, all the
wind players surrounded me; they were frightened at the idea of playing
in public an overture wholly unknown to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;the parts are all right, you are all talented
players; watch my stick as much as possible, count your rests, and it
will go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was not a mistake. I started the <i>allegro</i> in the whirlwind time
of the Transteverine dancers; the audience shouted, &lsquo;<i>Bis!</i>&rsquo; We played
the overture again, and it went even better the second time. I went to
the foyer and found Habeneck. He was rather disappointed. As I passed
him, I flung at him these few words: &lsquo;Now you see what it really is!&rsquo;
He carefully refrained from answering me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have I felt more keenly than on this occasion the pleasure of
conducting my own music, and my pleasure was doubled by thinking
on what Habeneck had made me suffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor composers, learn to conduct, and conduct yourselves well!
(Take the pun, if you please.) For the most dangerous of your
interpreters is the conductor. Don&rsquo;t forget this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The overture is scored for two flutes (and piccolo), two oboes,
English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets,
two cornets, three trombones, kettledrums, two side drums, cymbals,
triangle, and strings.</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">ERNEST</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BLOCH</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Geneva, Switzerland, July 24, 1880)</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;SCHELOMO&rdquo; (SOLOMON), HEBREW RHAPSODY FOR VIOLONCELLO AND ORCHESTRA</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Bloch is most inspired when he stands firmly and proudly
on Jewish ground. The well equipped composer is seen in all that
he writes, but his three Jewish Poems for orchestra, his Psalms,
for voice and orchestra, his <i>Schelomo</i>, are far above his what might
be called Gentile work, even above his concerto, not to mention
the cycloramic <i>America</i>. As he has written in an account of himself
and his artistic beliefs, it is the Jewish soul that interests him:
&ldquo;the complex, glowing, agitated soul&rdquo; that he feels vibrating
through the Bible. No wonder that the despair of the Preacher in
Jerusalem and the splendor of Solomon alike appealed to him;
the monarch in all his glory; the Preacher, who when he looked
on all his works that his hands had wrought and on the labor that
he had labored to do, could only explain: &ldquo;And behold, all was
vanity, and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the
Sun.&rdquo; And so Mr. Bloch might have taken as a motto for this
Hebrew rhapsody the lines of Rueckert:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Solomon! Where is thy throne? It is gone in the wind</i></p>
<p class="t0"><span class="gs">. . . . . . . . . . .</span></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Say what is pleasure? A phantom, a mask undefined.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Science? An almond, whereof we can pierce but the rind.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Honor and affluence? Firmans that Fortune hath signed</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Only to glitter and pass on the wings of the wind.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Other composers have taken Solomon for their hero; as Handel
in his oratorio; Goldmark, representing him as mighty and jealous
in <i>The Queen of Sheba</i>; Gounod in the opera similarly entitled,
based on the wildly fantastic tale of Gerard de Nerval; there are
older operas, but all, or nearly all, are concerned with <i>Grand
Turke</i>, the Sultan of the Ottomans. It was left for Mr. Bloch to
express in music the magnificence and the pessimistic, despairing
philosophy of the ruler to whom is falsely attributed the book,
Ecclesiastes. Here is music that does not brook conventional
analysis; music that is now purely lyrical, now dramatic, now pictorial;
music that rises to gorgeous heights and sinks to the depths;
with a conclusion that is not of the Preacher, the pious admonition
after summing up the whole matter, but a conclusion voiced by
the violoncello: &ldquo;There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest.&rdquo; Here is no Solomon,
lord of all creatures at whose name Afrites and evil genii trembled,
the Solomon of the &ldquo;Thousand Nights and a Night,&rdquo; here is the
monarch that having known power and all the pleasures, enumerating
them&mdash;even to &ldquo;the delights of the sons of men, as
musical instruments, and that of all sorts&rdquo;&mdash;reasoned that everything
was futile; that all was vanity.</p>
<p>One might therefore infer that this rhapsody is distressingly
somber, for nothing is more wearisome than a long-drawn-out
complaint. The inference would be wrong, for Mr. Bloch has
imagined in tones, in superbly exultant measures, the pomp and
sumptuousness of the King enthroned. There are orchestral bursts
of glorification; between them are recitatives and lyric reflections
for the jaded voluptuary, the embittered philosopher. The ingenuity
displayed is as remarkable as the individuality, the originality
shown by the composer stirred in his soul not only by the story
of Solomon; moved mightily by the thought of ancient days, the
succeeding trials and persecution of his race. More than once in
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
the rhapsody, if there is a suggestion of Solomon&rsquo;s court and
temple, there is also the suggestion of the Wailing Wall.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Schelomo</i> was composed at Geneva, Switzerland, in the first two
months of 1916. With the <i>Trois po&egrave;mes juifs</i> (composed in 1916) and
the symphony <i>Israel</i> (1913-18), it is that portion of Mr. Bloch&rsquo;s work
that is peculiarly Hebraic in character. In a letter to the writer of these
notes in 1917, Mr. Bloch wrote that the Psalms, <i>Schelomo</i>, and
<i>Israel</i> were more representative than the <i>Jewish Poems</i> because they
came from the passion and the violence that he believed to be
characteristics of his nature. &ldquo;It is not my purpose, not my desire, to
attempt a &lsquo;reconstitution&rsquo; of Jewish music, or to base my works on
melodies more or less authentic. I am not an arch&aelig;ologist. I hold it of
first importance to write good, genuine music, my music. It is the
Jewish soul that interests me, the complex, glowing, agitated soul, that
I feel vibrating throughout the Bible; the freshness and na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the
Patriarchs; the violence that is evident in the prophetic books; the
Jew&rsquo;s savage love of justice; the despair of the Preacher in Jerusalem;
the sorrow and the immensity of the Book of Job; the sensuality of the
Song of Songs. All this is in us; all this is in me, and it is the better
part of me. It is all this that I endeavor to hear in myself and to
transcribe in my music: the venerable emotion of the race that slumbers
way down in our soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Musical Quarterly</i> of January, 1921, published a translation by
Theodore Baker of Guido M. Gatti&rsquo;s estimate of <i>Schelomo</i> contributed
to <i>La Critica musicale</i> of April-May, 1920:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hebrew rhapsody for solo violoncello with orchestra bears the
name of the great king Solomon. In this, without taking thought
for development and formal consistency, without the fetters of a
text requiring interpretation, he has given free course to his fancy;
the multiplex figure of the founder of the Great Temple lent itself,
after setting it upon a lofty throne, and chiseling its lineaments, to the
creation of a phantasmagorical entourage of persons and scenes in rapid
and kaleidoscopic succession. The violoncello, with its ample breadth
of phrasing, now melodic and with moments of superb lyricism, now
declamatory and with robustly dramatic lights and shades, lends itself
to a reincarnation of Solomon in all his glory, surrounded by his thousand
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
wives and concubines, with his multitude of slaves and warriors
behind him. His voice resounds in the devotional silence, and the
sentences of his wisdom sink into the heart as the seed into a fertile
soil: &lsquo;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, ... all is vanity. What
profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? One
generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth
abideth for ever.... He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.&rsquo;...
At times the sonorous voice of the violoncello is heard
predominant amid a breathless and fateful obscurity throbbing with
persistent rhythms, again, it blends in a phantasmagorical paroxysm of
polychromatic tones, shot through with silvery clangors and frenzies of
exultation. And anon one finds oneself in the heart of a dream-world,
in an Orient of fancy, where men and women of every race and tongue
are holding argument or hurling maledictions; and now and again we
hear the mournful accents of the prophetic seer, under the influence of
which all bow down and listen reverently. The entire discourse of the
soloist, vocal rather than instrumental, seems like musical expression
intimately conjoined with the Talmudic prose. The pauses, the repetitions
of entire passages, the leaps of a double octave, the chromatic
progressions, all find their analogues in the Book of Ecclesiastes&mdash;in
the versicles, in the fairly epigraphic reiteration of the admonitions
(&lsquo;and all is vanity and vexation of spirit&rsquo;), in the unexpected shifts
from one thought to another, in certain <i>crescendi</i> of emotion that end
in explosions of anger or grief uncontrolled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Schelomo</i> is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes (and
English horn), two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contra-bassoon,
four horns, four trumpets, three trombones and tuba, kettledrums,
tambourine, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, celesta, two harps,

<p>Only a Russian can do justice to this music, which is wildly
Russian; that is to say, the Russia of the Orient. One is tempted,
hearing the repetitions of the first leading theme, a motto phrase
it may be called, to say with Hamlet: &ldquo;Leave thy damnable faces
and begin,&rdquo; but the monotony of repetition becomes irrepressive.
A Russian critic was reminded more than once in the course of
the first and last movements of the ancient Russian knights in
their awkwardness, also in their greatness. We are told that
Borodin intended to portray them in tones. He himself said that
in the slow movement he wished to recall the songs of Slav
troubadours; to picture in the first movement the gatherings of
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
princes, and in the <i>finale</i> the banquets of heroes where the Russian
Guzla and bamboo flute were heard while the mighty men
caroused. It is easy in the lyrical passages to be reminded of corresponding
phrases in <i>Prince Igor</i>, nor is this surprising, for he
was working on the symphony and the opera at the same time.
He was then obsessed by the life of feudal Russia.</p>
<p>No composer can be called great simply because he is a nationalist
in his music. The folk tunes of a nation have often worked
damage to the composer relying on them for his themes, and
content with the mere exposition of them. Rimsky-Korsakov and
Moussorgsky were nationalists, but their music passed the frontier;
it gives pleasure in every country. Is Borodin to be ranked with
them?</p>
<p>Eric Blom, speaking of Borodin as a pioneer, remembers how
he was once condemned as an &ldquo;incompetent amateur who wrote
hideous discords because he did not know the rules of harmony&rdquo;&mdash;an
unwarranted and foolish condemnation, as unjust as Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s
characterization in the bitter letter he wrote to Mme von
Meck in 1878 the year after this symphony was first heard. Admitting
that Borodin had talent, &ldquo;a very great talent,&rdquo; he said that it had
come to nothing for the want of teaching, &ldquo;because blind fate has
led him into the science laboratories instead of a vital musical
existence.&rdquo; The reference was to Borodin&rsquo;s fame as a chemist at
the Academy of Medicine. This was written when Tchaikovsky
was accused of that atrocious crime, cosmopolitanism, by his fellow
laborers in the Russian vineyard.</p>
<p>There are pages of splendid savagery in this symphony; there
are a few wild, haunting melodies. No, the composer of the two
symphonies, one at least of the string quartets, and a handful of

<p>Borodin&rsquo;s Symphony in B minor was written during the years
1871-77. The first performance was at St. Petersburg in the Hall of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Nobility, February 14, 1877, and Eduard Napravnik was the conductor.</p>
<p>Borodin&rsquo;s First symphony, in E flat major, was begun in 1862 and
completed in 1867. Stassov furnished him with the scenario of a
libretto founded on an epic and national poem, the story of Prince
Igor. This poem told of the expedition of Russian princes against the
Polovtsi, a nomadic people of the same origin as the Turks, who had
invaded the Russian Empire in the twelfth century. The conflict of
Russian and Asiatic nationalities delighted Borodin, and he began to
write his own libretto. He tried to live in the atmosphere of the bygone
century. He read the poems and the songs that had come down
from the people of that period; he collected folk songs even from
Central Asia; he introduced in the libretto comic characters to give
contrast to romantic situations; and he began to compose the music,
when at the end of a year he was seized with profound discouragement.
His friends said to him: &ldquo;The time has gone by to write operas
on historic or legendary subjects; today it is necessary to treat the
modern drama.&rdquo; When anyone deplored in his presence the loss of so
much material, he replied that this material would go into a second
symphony. He began work on this symphony, and the first movement
was completed in the autumn of 1871. But the director of the Russian
opera wished to produce an operatic ballet, <i>Mlada</i>. The subject was
of an epoch before Christianity. The fourth act was intrusted to
Borodin: it included religious scenes, apparitions of the ghosts of old
Slavonic princes, an inundation, and the destruction of a temple; and
human interest was supplied by a love scene. Faithful to his theories,
Borodin began to study the manners and the religion of this people.
He composed feverishly and did not leave his room for days at a
time. Although the work was prepared by the composers&mdash;Minkus was
to write the ballet music, and Borodin, Cui, Moussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov
the vocal music&mdash;the scenery demanded such an expense that
the production was postponed, and Borodin began work again on his
Second symphony and <i>Prince Igor</i>. He worked under disadvantages: his
wife, Catherine Serge&iuml;evna Protopopova (she died August 9, 1887), an
excellent pianist, was an invalid, and his own health was wretched. In
1877 he wrote: &ldquo;We old sinners, as always, are in the whirlwind of life&mdash;professional
duty, science, art. We hurry on and do not reach the
goal. Time flies like an express train. The beard grows gray, wrinkles
make deeper hollows. We begin a hundred different things. Shall we
ever finish any of them? I am always a poet in my soul, and I nourish
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
the hope of leading my opera to the last measure, and yet I often mock
at myself. I advance slowly, and there are great gaps in my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borodin in a letter (January 31, 1877) to his friend, Mme Ludmilla
Ivanovna Karmalina, to whom he told his hopes, disappointments,
enthusiasms, wrote: &ldquo;The Musical Society had determined to perform
my Second symphony at one of its concerts. I was in the country and
did not know this fact. When I came back to St. Petersburg, I could not
find the first movement and the <i>finale</i>. The score of these movements
was lost; I had without doubt mislaid it. I hunted everywhere, but
could not find it; yet the Society insisted, and there was hardly time to
have the parts copied. What should I do? To crown all, I fell sick. I
could not shuffle the thing off, and I was obliged to reorchestrate my
symphony. Nailed to my bed by fever, I wrote the score in pencil. My
copy was not ready in time, and my symphony will not be performed
till the next concert. My two symphonies then will be performed in the
same week. Never has a professor of the Academy of Medicine and
Surgery been found in such a box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Second symphony was at first unsuccessful. Ivanov wrote in the
<i>Nouveau Temps</i>: &ldquo;Hearing this music, you are reminded of the ancient
Russian knights in all their awkwardness and also in all their greatness.
There is heaviness even in the lyric and tender passages. These massive
forms are at times tiresome; they crush the hearer.&rdquo; But Stassov tells us
that Borodin endeavored by this music to portray the knights. &ldquo;Like
Glinka, Borodin is an epic poet. He is not less national than Glinka,
but the Oriental element plays with him the part it plays for Glinka,
Dargomijsky, Balakirev, Moussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov. He belongs
to the composers of programme music. He can say with Glinka: &lsquo;For
my limitless imagination I must have a precise and given text.&rsquo;&rdquo; Of
Borodin&rsquo;s two symphonies the second is the greater work, and it owes
its force to the maturity of the composer&rsquo;s talent, but especially to the
national character with which it is impregnated by the programme.
The old heroic Russian form dominates it as it does <i>Prince Igor</i>.</p>
<p>The symphony is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes,
English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets,
three trombones, bass tuba, three kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals,
triangle, tambourine, harp, and the usual strings.</p>
<p>It appears from the score that this symphony was edited by Rimsky-Korsakov
and Glazounov.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro</i>, B minor, 2-2. The first movement opens with a vigorous
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
theme given out by the strings in unison, while bassoons and horns
reinforce each alternate measure. This theme may be taken for the
motto of the movement, and it is heard in every section of it. Another
motive, <i>animato assai</i>, is given to the wood-wind. After the alternation
of these two musical thoughts, the expressive second theme, <i>poco meno
mosso</i>, 3-2 time, is introduced by the violoncellos, and afterward by
the wood-wind. The vigorous first theme is soon heard again from
the full orchestra. There is development. The time changes from 2-2 to
3-2, but the motto dominates with a development of the first measure
of the second subject. This material is worked at length. A pedal point,
with persistent rhythm for the drum, leads to the recapitulation section,
in which the theme undergoes certain modifications. The <i>coda</i>, <i>animato
assai</i>, is built on the motto.</p>
<p>II. <i>Scherzo</i>, <i>prestissimo</i>, F major, 1-1 time. There are a few introductory
measures with repeated notes for first and second horn. The
chief theme is followed by a new thought (syncopated unison of all
the strings). This alternates with the first theme.</p>
<p><i>Trio</i>: <i>Allegretto</i>, 6-4. A melody for the oboe is repeated by the
clarinet, and triangle and harp come in on each alternate half of every
measure. This material is developed. The first part of the movement
is repeated, and the <i>coda</i> ends <i>pianissimo</i>.</p>
<p>III. <i>Andante</i>, D flat major, 4-4. There are introductory measures in
which a clarinet is accompanied by the harp. A horn sings the song of
the old troubadours. <i>Poco animato</i>. There is a tremolo for strings, and
the opening melody, changed somewhat, is heard from wood-wind
instruments and horns. <i>Poco pi&ugrave; animato</i>, 3-4. A new thought is given
to the strings with a chromatic progression in the bass. After the
climax the opening theme returns (strings), and the movement ends
with the little clarinet solo. Then comes, without a pause, the</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale.</i> <i>Allegro</i>, B major, 3-4. The movement is in sonata form.
There is an introduction. The chief theme, <i>forte</i>, is given to the full
orchestra. It is in 5-4. The second subject, less tumultuous, is given to
clarinet, followed by flute and oboe. The chief theme is developed,
<i>lento</i>, in the trombones and tuba, and in a more lively manner by
strings and wood-wind. The second subject is developed, first by
strings, then by full orchestra. The recapitulation section is preceded
by the introductory material for the opening of the movement.</p>

<p class="center">(Born at Hamburg, May 7, 1833; died at Vienna, April 3, 1897)</p>
<p>Those who like to know about composers as human beings rejoice
in the knowledge that Beethoven was irascible, the despair
of his landladies, given to rough joking; that Haydn was nagged
by his shrew of a wife and fell in love in London with a widow;
that Mozart was fond of punch and billiards; that C&eacute;sar Franck&rsquo;s
trousers were too short. There are many anecdotes about the great,
some of them no doubt apocryphal.</p>
<p>In the excellent biography of Brahms by Walter Niemann<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
there is an entertaining chapter entitled &ldquo;Brahms as a Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not fussy in his dress. At home he went about in a
flannel shirt, trousers, a detachable white collar, no cravat, slippers.
In the country he was happy in a flannel shirt and alpaca jacket,
carrying a soft felt hat in his hand, and in bad weather wearing
on his shoulders an old-fashioned bluish-green shawl, fastened in
front by a huge pin. (In the &rsquo;sixties many New Englanders on their
perilous journeys to Boston or New York wore a shawl.) He preferred
a modest restaurant to a hotel table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te. In his music
room were pictures of a few composers, engravings&mdash;the Sistine
Madonna among them&mdash;the portrait of Cherubini, by Ingres, with
a veiled Muse crowning the composer&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot stand that
female,&rdquo; Brahms said to his landlady&mdash;a bronze relief of Bismarck,
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
always crowned with laurel. There was a square piano on which
a volume of Bach was usually standing open. On the cover lay
notebooks, writing tablets, calendars, cigar cases, spectacles, purses,
watches, keys, portfolios, recently published books and music, also
souvenirs of his travels. He was passionately patriotic, interested
in politics, a firm believer in German unity. He deeply regretted
that he had not done military service as a young man. Prussia
should be the North German predominant power.</p>
<p class="tb">A Viennese musician once said that whenever he heard one
of Brahms&rsquo; symphonies he was inclined to prefer it to the other
three; but he was a passionate Brahmsite. The second has a freshness
and a spontaneity that are perhaps not found in the others,
though the third presses it hard in these respects; but there is a
rugged grandeur in the first that puts it above the others.</p>
<p class="tb">Professor Schweizerhoffsteinlein, the celebrated Wagnerite, once
said: &ldquo;To me, however many movements there are in an orchestral
work of Johannes Brahms, to me&mdash;hear me once&mdash;there are only
two: he makes the first, and I make the second.&rdquo; But the eminent
professor was no doubt unjust toward Brahms, in his clumsy ponderous
way.</p>
<p class="tb">The sensuousness of Brahms is cerebral; it might be called
Platonic. There are various kinds of sensuousness in music, as in
human life. Some years ago Jos&eacute;phin P&eacute;ladan, the fantastical Sar
of dark corners, likened the music of Brahms to a gypsy woman
dancing in tight-fitting corsets. He detected &ldquo;latent heat beneath
the formal exterior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brahms&rsquo; First symphony contains remarkable pages, as those of
the first movement, passages in the second, and the marvelously
poetic introduction to the final <i>allegro</i>. Mr. Apthorp&rsquo;s belief that
this introductory episode may have been suggested to Brahms by
the tones of the Alpine horn is not too fanciful, and this impression
is made on all that have heard the horn whether in
the Oberland or high up in the Canton Vaud. Brahms&rsquo; fondness
for Switzerland is well known, and he had visited that country
before the <i>finale</i> was performed. In this introductory <i>adagio</i> there
is a lyric flight and at the same time an imaginative force in superb
decoration that are seldom found in the purely orchestral compositions
of Brahms.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Brahms was not in a hurry to write a symphony. He heeded not
the wishes or demands of his friends, he was not disturbed by their
impatience. As far back as 1854 Schumann wrote to Joachim: &ldquo;But
where is Johannes? Is he flying high or only under the flowers? Is he
not yet ready to let drums and trumpets sound? He should always
keep in mind the beginning of the Beethoven symphonies; he should
try to make something like them. The beginning is the main thing; if
only one makes a beginning, then the end comes of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max Kalbeck, of Vienna, the author of a life of Brahms in 2,138
pages, is of the opinion that the beginning, or rather the germ, of the
Symphony in C minor is to be dated 1855. In 1854 Brahms heard in
Cologne for the first time Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth symphony. It impressed
him greatly, so that he resolved to write a symphony in the same
tonality. This symphony he never completed. The first two movements
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
were later used for the Pianoforte concerto in D minor, and the third
for &ldquo;Behold all flesh&rdquo; in <i>A German Requiem</i>.</p>
<p>A performance of Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Manfred</i> also excited him when he
was twenty-two. Kalbeck has much to say about the influence of these
works and the tragedy in the Schumann family over Brahms, as the
composer of the C minor symphony. The contents of the symphony,
according to Kalbeck, portray the relationship between Brahms and
Robert and Clara Schumann. The biographer finds significance in the
first measures, <i>poco sostenuto</i>, that serve as introduction to the first
<i>allegro</i>. It was Richard Grant White who said of the German commentator
on Shakespeare that the deeper he dived the muddier he
came up.</p>
<p>Just when Brahms began to make the first sketches of this symphony
is not exactly known. He was in the habit, as a young man, of
jotting down his musical thoughts when they occurred to him. Later
he worked on several compositions at the same time and let them
grow under his hand. There are instances where this growth was of
very long duration. He destroyed the great majority of his sketches.
The few that he did not destroy are, or were recently, in the library
of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde at Vienna.</p>
<p>In 1862 Brahms showed his friend Albert Dietrich an early version
of the first movement of the symphony. It was then without the
introduction. The first movement was afterwards greatly changed.
Walter Niemann quotes Brahms as saying that it was no laughing
matter to write a symphony after Beethoven; &ldquo;and again, after finishing
the first movement of the First symphony, he admitted to his friend
Levi: &lsquo;I shall never compose a symphony! You have no conception of
how the likes of us feel when we hear the tramp of a giant like him
[Beethoven] behind us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The first movement opens with a short introduction, <i>un poco
sostenuto</i>, C minor, 6-8, which leads without a pause into the first
movement proper, <i>allegro</i>, C minor. Second movement, <i>andante
sostenuto</i>, E major, 3-4. The place of the traditional <i>scherzo</i> is supplied
by a movement, <i>un poco allegretto e grazioso</i>, A flat major, 2-4.
The <i>finale</i> begins with an <i>adagio</i>, C minor, 4-4, in which there are
hints of the themes of the <i>allegro</i> which follows. Here William Foster
Apthorp should be quoted:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;With the thirtieth measure the tempo changes to <i>pi&ugrave; andante</i>, and
we come upon one of the most poetic episodes in all Brahms. Amid
hushed, tremulous harmonies in the strings, the horn and afterward
the flute pour forth an utterly original melody, the character of which
ranges from passionate pleading to a sort of wild exultation, according
to the instrument that plays it. The coloring is enriched by the
solemn tones of the trombones, which appear for the first time in this
movement. It is ticklish work trying to dive down into a composer&rsquo;s
brain, and surmise what special outside source his inspiration may have
had; but one cannot help feeling that this whole wonderful episode
may have been suggested to Brahms by the tones of the Alpine horn,
as it awakens the echoes from mountain after mountain on some of
the high passes in the Bernese Oberland. This is certainly what the
episode recalls to anyone who has ever heard those poetic tones and
their echoes. A short, solemn, even ecclesiastical interruption by the
trombones and bassoons is of more thematic importance. As the horn
tones gradually die away, and the cloudlike harmonies in the strings
sink lower and lower&mdash;like mist veiling the landscape&mdash;an impressive
pause ushers in the <i>allegro non troppo, ma con brio</i> (in C major, 4-4
time). The introductory <i>adagio</i> has already given us mysterious hints
at what is to come; and now there bursts forth in the strings the
most joyous, exuberant <i>Volkslied</i> melody, a very Hymn to Joy, which
in some of its phrases, as it were unconsciously and by sheer affinity of
nature, flows into strains from the similar melody in the <i>finale</i> of
Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth symphony. One cannot call it plagiarism: it is two
men saying the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony was produced at Carlsruhe by the Grand Duke&rsquo;s
orchestra on November 4, 1876. Dessoff conducted from manuscript.
Brahms was present. There was a performance a few days later at
Mannheim, where Brahms conducted.</p>
<p>Richard Specht,<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> stating that the First symphony made its way
slowly&mdash;even Hanslick was far from being enthusiastic&mdash;attributes the
fact largely to unsatisfactory interpretations.</p>
<p>After the first performance in Boston (by the Harvard Musical Association,
January 3, 1878), John S. Dwight wrote in his <i>Journal of
Music</i> that the total impression made on him was &ldquo;as something depressing
and unedifying, a work coldly elaborated, artificial; earnest to
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
be sure, in some sense great, and far more satisfactory than any symphony
by Raff, or any others of the day, which we have heard; but
not to be mentioned in the same day with any symphony by Schumann,
Mendelssohn, or the great one by Schubert, not to speak of Beethoven&rsquo;s....
Our interest in it will increase, but we foresee the limit; and
certainly it cannot be popular; it will not be loved like the dear masterpieces
of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latest biographers of Johannes Brahms differ curiously
concerning the character of the Second symphony. The excellent
Walter Niemann finds a tragic undercurrent; &ldquo;ghostly elements
glimmering in a supernatural, uncanny way&rdquo;; even &ldquo;mysterious
Wagnerian visions.&rdquo; The equally excellent Richard Specht finds
sunshine, fair days, warm winds, clarity, and tenderness. Brahms
can on occasion be gloomy and crabbed enough. Why cannot Mr.
Niemann, a devoted admirer of Johannes, allow him to be cheerful
once in a while, as in this Second symphony?</p>
<p class="tb">The Symphony in D is the most genial of the four, the most
easily accepted by an audience, for, if there are pages of supreme
beauty in it, as toward the end of the first movement, so there
are pages that are Mendelssohnian in form and in the rhythm of
the easily retained melodic thought. Mendelssohn, a shrewd composer,
seldom, if ever, committed the blunder of surprising an
audience. As in the theater, so in the concert hall, an audience
does not wish to be left in doubt, and in this symphony, which
is in reality a storehouse of truly beautiful things, there is every
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
now and then a passage that is accepted by the hearer as an agreeable
commonplace.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Chamber music, choral works, pianoforte pieces, and songs had made
Brahms famous before he allowed his First symphony to be played.
The Symphony in C minor was performed for the first time in 1876.
Kirchner wrote in a letter to Marie Lipsius that he had talked about
this symphony in 1863 or 1864 with Mme Clara Schumann, who then
showed him fragments of it. No one knew, it is said, of the existence
of a second symphony before it was completed.</p>
<p>The Second symphony, in D major, was composed, probably at
P&ouml;rtschach-am-See, in the summer of 1877, the year that saw the
publication of the first. Brahms wrote Dr. Billroth in September of
that year: &ldquo;I do not know whether I have a pretty symphony; I must
inquire of skilled persons.&rdquo; He referred to Clara Schumann, Dessoff,
and Ernst Frank. On September 19, Mme Schumann wrote that he
had written out the first movement. Early in October he played it
to her, also a portion of the <i>finale</i>. The symphony was played by
Brahms and Ignaz Br&uuml;ll as a pianoforte duet (arranged by the composer)
to invited guests at the pianoforte house of his friend Ehrbar in
Vienna a few days before the announced date of the orchestral performance,
December 11, 1877. Through force of circumstances the
symphony was played for the first time in public at the succeeding
Philharmonic concert of December 30. Hans Richter conducted. The
second performance, conducted by Brahms, was at the Gewandhaus,
Leipsic, on January 10, 1878.</p>
<p>Certain German critics in their estimate of Brahms have exhausted
themselves in comparison and metaphor. One claims that, as Beethoven&rsquo;s
Fourth symphony is to his <i>Eroica</i>, so is Brahms&rsquo; Second to his First;
the one in C minor is epic, the one in D major is a fairy tale. When
B&uuml;low wrote that Brahms was an heir of Cherubini, he referred to
the delicate filigree work shown in the <i>finale</i> of the second. Felix
Weingartner, whose <i>Die Symphonie nach Beethoven</i> (Berlin, 1898) is
a pamphlet of singularly acute and discriminative criticism, coolly says
that the Second is far superior to the First: &ldquo;The stream of invention
has never flowed so fresh and spontaneous in other works by Brahms,
and nowhere else has he colored his orchestration so successfully.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
And after a eulogy of the movements he puts the symphony among the
very best of the new classic school since the death of Beethoven&mdash;&ldquo;far
above all the symphonies of Schumann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard Specht, in his Life of Brahms, writes: &ldquo;The work is suffused
with the sunshine and the warm winds playing on the water, which
recall the summer at P&ouml;rtschach that gave it life. The comfortably
swinging first subject at once creates a sense of well-being with its
sincere and sensuous gladness.... This movement is like a fair day
in its creator&rsquo;s life and outshines the other three sections&mdash;the brooding
<i>andante</i>, the rather unimportant <i>scherzo</i> ... the broad, sweeping
<i>finale</i> which, for all its lively, driving motion, strikes one as cheerless
and artificial in its briskness. The impression of the unsymphonic
nature of this work is probably due partly to a prejudice that expects
to see cosmic images and not mere genre pictures in such a composition,
and partly to the meter adopted for the first movement. It is remarkable
that Brahms did not employ the common time almost invariably
used by the symphonic masters from Mozart to Schubert in
their opening movements until he came to his Fourth symphony. The
round-dance nature of the 3-4 measure in the D major symphony is
especially difficult to take seriously, and rightly so; for this is a light-hearted
work, a declaration of love in symphonic form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brahms was particularly fond of this dear and tender composition,
as might be judged from the little mystifications with which he raised
the expectations his friends had of the new work that followed its elder
sister within the space of a year. He persisted in describing it as gloomy
and awesome, never to be played by any musicians without a mourning
band on their sleeve.&rdquo; (As a matter of fact Brahms wrote to Elisabet
von Herzogenberg on December 29, 1877: &ldquo;The orchestra here play
my new symphony with crape bands on their sleeves, because of its
dirge-like effect. It is to be printed with a black edge, too.&rdquo;) &ldquo;He replied
in a tone of waggish secrecy to Elisabet, who was impatiently
waiting for the score and scolded him for not rewarding her discretion
by sending her the work, which she knew to be ready (&lsquo;May the deuce
take such modesty!&rsquo;) and who, incidentally, took exception to his
spelling so noble a word as &lsquo;symphony&rsquo; with an &lsquo;f&rsquo;. &lsquo;It really is no symphony,&rsquo;
he writes, &lsquo;but merely a <i>Sinfonie</i>, and I shall have no need to
play it to you beforehand. You merely sit down at the piano, put your
little feet on the two pedals in turn, and strike the chord of F minor
several times in succession, first in the treble, then in the bass <i>ff</i> and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
<i>pp</i> and you will gradually gain a vivid impression of my &ldquo;latest.&rdquo;&rsquo; And
he was as pleased as Punch with the glad surprise and delight of the
adored woman and of all his friends when they saw this sunny work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some justly prefer the Symphony in F major to the other three.
It has no pages equal in imagination to the wonderful introduction
to the <i>finale</i> of the First; it has nothing in it like the architectural
grandeur of the Fourth&rsquo;s <i>finale</i>; but, as a whole, it is the
most poetic of the four. Brahms wrote nothing more commanding
than the opening of the first movement. Page after page thereafter
might be cited in praise. And in this symphony the natural
austerity of the composer is mellowed, his melancholy, as in the
third movement, is tender, wistful, not pessimistic.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Brahms worked on his Third symphony in 1882, and in the summer
of 1883 he completed it.</p>
<p>The first performance of the Third symphony was at a Philharmonic
concert in Vienna, December 2, 1883. Hans Richter conducted. Brahms
feared for the performance, although Richter had conducted four
rehearsals. He wrote to B&uuml;low that at these rehearsals he missed the
Forum Romanum (the theater scene which in Meiningen served as a
concert hall for rehearsals), and would not be wholly comfortable until
the public gave unqualified approval. Max Kalbeck states that at the
first performance in Vienna a crowd of the Wagner-Bruckner <i>ecclesia
militans</i> stood in the pit to make a hostile demonstration, and there
was hissing after the applause following each movement had died
away; but the general public was so appreciative that the hissing was
drowned and enthusiasm was at its height. Arthur Faber came near
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
fighting a duel with an inciter of the <i>Skandal</i> sitting behind him, but
forgot the disagreeable incident at the supper given by him in honor of
the production of the symphony, with Dr. Billroth, Simrock, Goldmark,
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, Br&uuml;ll, Hellmesberger, Richter, Hanslick, among the guests. At
this concert Franz Ondricek played the new violin concerto of
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k.</p>
<p>It is said that various periodicals asserted that this symphony was by
far the best of Brahms&rsquo; compositions. This greatly annoyed the composer,
especially as it raised expectations which he thought could not be
fulfilled. Brahms sent the manuscript to Joachim in Berlin and asked
him to conduct the second performance where or at what time he
liked. For a year or more the friendship between the two had been
clouded, for Brahms had sided with Mrs. Joachim in the domestic
dispute, or at least he had preserved his accustomed intimacy with her,
and Joachim had resented this. The second performance, led by
Joachim, was at Berlin, January 4, 1884. Dr. Franz W&uuml;llner was then
the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra Subscription Concerts.
Brahms had promised him in the summer before the honor of
conducting this symphony in Berlin for the first time. Joachim insisted
that he should be the conductor. Churlish in the matter, he persuaded
Brahms to break his promise to W&uuml;llner by saying that he would play
Brahms&rsquo; violin concerto under the composer&rsquo;s direction if Brahms
would allow him to conduct the symphony. Brahms then begged
W&uuml;llner to make the sacrifice. Joachim therefore conducted it at an
Academy Concert, but Brahms was not present; he came about a fortnight
later to W&uuml;llner&rsquo;s first subscription concert, and then conducted
the symphony and played his pianoforte concerto in D minor. The
writer of these notes was at this concert. The symphony was applauded
enthusiastically, but Brahms was almost as incompetent a conductor
as Joachim. (His pianoforte playing in 1884 on that occasion was
muddy and noisy.) Brahms conducted the symphony at Wiesbaden on
January 18, 1884. The copyright of the manuscript was sold to the
publisher Simrock, of Berlin, for 36,000 marks ($9,000) and a percentage
on sums realized by performances.</p>
<p>Hans Richter in a toast christened this symphony when it was still
in manuscript, the &ldquo;<i>Eroica</i>.&rdquo; Hanslick remarked concerning this:
&ldquo;Truly, if Brahms&rsquo; First symphony in C minor is characterized as the
&lsquo;<i>Pathetic</i>&rsquo; or the &lsquo;<i>Appassionata</i>&rsquo; and the second in D major as the
&lsquo;<i>Pastoral</i>,&rsquo; the new symphony in F major may be appropriately called
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
his &lsquo;<i>Eroica</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;; yet Hanslick took care to add that the key word was
not wholly to the point, for only the first movement and the <i>finale</i> are
of heroic character. This Third symphony, he says, is indeed a new
one. &ldquo;It repeats neither the poignant song of Fate of the first, nor the
joyful Idyl of the second; its fundamental note is proud strength that
rejoices in deeds. The heroic element is without any warlike flavor; it
leads to no tragic action, such as the Funeral March in Beethoven&rsquo;s
<i>Eroica</i>. It recalls in its musical character the healthy and full vigor of
Beethoven&rsquo;s second period, and nowhere the singularities of his last
period; and every now and then in passages quivers the romantic
twilight of Schumann and Mendelssohn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max Kalbeck thinks that the statue of Germania near R&uuml;desheim
inspired Brahms to write this symphony.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Joachim found Hero and
Leander in the <i>finale</i>! He associated the second motive in C major
with the bold swimmer breasting the waves. Clara Schumann entitled
the symphony a &ldquo;Forest Idyl&rdquo; and sketched a programme for it.</p>
<p>The first movement, <i>allegro con brio</i>, in F major, 6-4, opens with
three introductory chords (horns, trumpets, wood-wind), the upper
voice of which, F, A flat, F, presents a short theme that is an emblematic
figure, or device, which recurs significantly throughout the
movement. Although it is not one of the regular themes, it plays a
dominating part. Some find in a following cross-relation&mdash;A flat of the
bass against the preceding A natural of the first theme, the &ldquo;Keynote
to some occult dramatic signification.&rdquo; Enharmonic modulation leads
to A major, the tonality of the second theme. There is first a slight
reminiscence of the &ldquo;Venusberg&rdquo; scene in <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Naht euch
dem Strande!</i>&rdquo; Dr. Hugo Riemann goes so far as to say that Brahms
may have thus paid a tribute to Wagner, who died in the period of
the composition of this symphony. The second theme is of a graceful
character, but of compressed form, in strong contrast with the broad
and sweeping first theme. The second movement, <i>andante</i> in C major,
4-4, opens with a hymnlike passage, which in the first three chords reminds
some persons of the &ldquo;Prayer&rdquo; in <i>Zampa</i>. The third movement is
a <i>poco allegretto</i>, C minor, 3-8, a romantic substitute for the traditional
<i>scherzo</i>. <i>Finale</i>, <i>allegro</i>, in F minor, 2-2. At the end the
strings in tremolo bring the original first theme of the first movement,
&ldquo;the ghost&rdquo; of this first theme, as Apthorp called it, over sustained
harmonies in the wind instruments.</p>

<p>Much of the Fourth symphony is melancholy and lamentful,
but it is relieved by the consolatory beatitude of the <i>andante</i> and
the elevating stateliness of the conclusion.... The austerity with
which the composer has been reproached&mdash;in many instances unjustly&mdash;is
here pronounced. The solidity of the structure may be
admired, but the structure itself is granitic and unrelieved. The
symphony has not the epic grandeur of the first, the geniality of
the second, the wealth of varied beauty that distinguishes the
third.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was first performed at Meiningen, October 25, 1885,
under the direction of the composer.</p>
<p>It was composed in the summers of 1884 and 1885 at M&uuml;rzzuschlag
in Styria: Miss Florence May in her Life of Brahms says that the
manuscript was nearly destroyed in 1885: &ldquo;Returning one afternoon
from a walk, he [Brahms] found that the house in which he lodged
had caught fire, and that his friends were busily engaged in bringing
his papers, and amongst them the nearly finished manuscript of the
new symphony, into the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter, Brahms described this symphony as &ldquo;a couple of
entr&rsquo;actes,&rdquo; also as &ldquo;a choral work without text.&rdquo; He was doubtful
about its worth. He consulted his friends, and he and Ignaz Br&uuml;ll
played a pianoforte arrangement in the presence of several of them.
He judged from their attitude that they did not like it and he was
much depressed. There was a preliminary orchestral rehearsal at
Meiningen in October, 1885, conducted by Hans von B&uuml;low. Brahms
arrived in time for the first performance. The symphony was most
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
warmly applauded, and the audience endeavored, but in vain, to obtain
a repetition of the third movement.</p>
<p>The symphony was performed at a Philharmonic concert in Vienna
on March 7, 1897, the last Philharmonic concert heard by Brahms. We
quote from Miss May&rsquo;s biography: &ldquo;The Fourth symphony had never
become a favorite work in Vienna. Received with reserve on its first
performance, it had not since gained much more from the general
public of the city than the respect sure to be accorded there to an important
work by Brahms. Today [<i>sic</i>], however, a storm of applause
broke out at the end of the first movement, not to be quieted until
the composer, coming to the front of the artist&rsquo;s box in which he was
seated, showed himself to the audience. The demonstration was renewed
after the second and the third movements, and an extraordinary
scene followed the conclusion of the work. The applauding, shouting
house, its gaze riveted on the figure standing in the balcony, so familiar
and yet in present aspect so strange, seemed unable to let him go. Tears
ran down his cheeks as he stood there, shrunken in form, with lined
countenance, strained expression, white hair hanging lank; and through
the audience there was a feeling as of a stifled sob, for each knew that
they were saying farewell. Another outburst of applause and yet another;
one more acknowledgment from the master; and Brahms and
his Vienna had parted forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heinrich Reimann gives a short description of the symphony: &ldquo;It
begins as in ballad fashion. Blaring fanfares of horns and cries of pain
interrupt the narration, which passes into an earnest and ardent melody
(B major, violoncellos). The themes, especially those in fanfare
fashion, change form and color. &lsquo;The formal appearance, now powerful,
prayerful, now caressing, tender, mocking, homely, now far away,
now near, now hurried, now quietly expanding, ever surprises us, is ever
welcome: it brings joy and gives dramatic impetus to the movement.&rsquo;
A theme of the second movement constantly returns in varied form,
from which the chief theme, the staccato figure given to the wind, and
the melodious song of the violoncellos are derived. The third movement,
<i>allegro giocoso</i>, sports with old-fashioned harmonies, which
should not be taken too seriously. This is not the case with the <i>finale</i>,
an artfully contrived <i>ciacona</i> of antique form, but of modern contents.
The first eight measures give the &lsquo;title-page&rsquo; of the <i>ciacona</i>. The
measures that follow are variations of the leading theme; wind instruments
prevail in the first three, then the strings enter; the movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
grows livelier, clarinets and oboes lead to E major; and now comes the
solemn climax of this movement, the trombone passage. The old theme
enters again after the <i>fermata</i>, and rises to full force, which finds expression
in a <i>pi&ugrave; allegro</i> for the close.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="h2line1">VARIATIONS ON A THEME BY JOSEF HAYDN, IN B FLAT MAJOR, OP. 56a</span></h2>
<p>At Bonn, in August, 1873, Brahms with Clara Schumann played to
a few friends the <i>Variations on a Theme by Haydn</i> in the version
(Op. 56b) for two pianofortes.</p>
<p>It is not definitely known whether the orchestral version or the one
for two pianofortes was the earlier. The orchestral stands first in
thematic catalogues of Brahms&rsquo; compositions, but the pianoforte version
was published first&mdash;in November, 1873. The probability is that the
orchestral version was the first. The autograph manuscript of Op. 56b
is dated at the end &ldquo;Tutzing July 1873.&rdquo; It was in November, 1870, that
C. F. Pohl showed Brahms the compositions of Haydn, an <i>andante</i>
from a symphony and the <i>chorale</i> that gave Brahms his theme. Kalbeck
believed that the score of Haydn&rsquo;s <i>chorale</i> put Brahms in mind
of the excellent wind choir of the Detmold Court Orchestra, and the
thought of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra gave him greater desire
to write an orchestral work.</p>
<p>The theme is taken from a collection of <i>divertimenti</i> for wind instruments
by Haydn. In the original score it is entitled <i>Chorale St. Antoni</i>.
The <i>divertimento</i> in which this theme occurs is in B flat major; it is
composed for two oboes, two horns, three bassoons, and a serpent. For
the third bassoon and the serpent Brahms substituted a double bassoon.
The <i>divertimento</i> was composed by Haydn probably about 1782-84 and
for open-air performance. It was performed at a concert in London in
March, 1908. As then played, it consisted of a lively introduction, the
<i>Chorale Sancti Antonii</i>, a <i>minuetto</i> and a <i>rondo</i>. It was then questioned
whether Haydn composed the <i>chorale</i>, and why the folk-song-like
tune was so named.</p>
<p>The theme is announced by Brahms in plain harmony by wind
instruments over a bass for violoncellos, double basses, and double
bassoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Variation I. <i>Poco pi&ugrave; andante.</i> The violins enter, and their figure
is accompanied by one in triplets in the violas and violoncellos. These
figures alternately change places. Wind instruments are added.</p>
<p>II. B flat minor, <i>pi&ugrave; vivace</i>. Clarinets and bassoons have a variation
of the theme, and violins enter with an <i>arpeggio</i> figure.</p>
<p>III. There is a return to the major, <i>con moto</i>, 2-4. The theme is
given to the oboes, doubled by the bassoons an octave below. There is
an independent accompaniment for the lower strings. In the repetition
the violins and violas take the part which the wind instruments had,
and the flutes, doubled by the bassoons, have <i>arpeggio</i> figures.</p>
<p>IV. In minor, 3-8. The melody is sung by oboe with horn; then it
is strengthened by the flute with the bassoon. The violas and shortly
after the violoncellos accompany in scale passage. The parts change
place in repetition.</p>
<p>V. This variation is a <i>vivace</i> in major, 6-8. The upper melody is
given to flutes, oboes, and bassoons, doubled through two octaves. In
the repetition the moving parts are taken by the strings.</p>
<p>VI. <i>Vivace</i>, major, 2-4. A new figure is introduced. During the first
four measures the strings accompany with the original theme in
harmony, afterwards in <i>arpeggio</i> and scale passages.</p>
<p>VII. <i>Grazioso</i>, major, 6-8. The violins an octave above the clarinets
descend through the scale, while the piccolo doubled by violas has a
fresh melody.</p>
<p>VIII. B flat minor, <i>presto non troppo</i>, 3-4. The strings are muted.
The mood is <i>pianissimo</i> throughout. The piccolo enters with an inversion
of the phrase.</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i> is in the major, 4-4. It is based throughout on a phrase,
an obvious modification of the original theme, which is used at first as
a ground bass&mdash;&ldquo;a bass passage constantly repeated and accompanied
each successive time with a varied melody and harmony.&rdquo; This obstinate
phrase is afterwards used in combination with other figures in other
passages of the <i>finale</i>. The original theme returns in the strings at the
climax; the wood-wind instruments accompany in scale passages, and
the brass fills up the harmony. The triangle is now used to the end.
Later the melody is played by wood and brass instruments, and the
strings have a running accompaniment.</p>
<p>The late Max Kalbeck in his long-winded and ponderous Life of
Brahms has much to say about these Variations. Which St. Anthony
was in Haydn&rsquo;s mind is immaterial. Kalbeck decided that Brahms&rsquo; hero
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
is the St. Anthony of Thebes. Brahms was a friend and admirer of
Anselm Feuerbach, the artist, who had painted a life-size Temptation
of St. Anthony, the monk kneeling with a book, a scourge, and a
skull near him, while a woman begs him to leave his religious meditation
and enter into life. This picture was so ridiculed that the sensitive
Feuerbach destroyed it, but it had been engraved and photographed.</p>
<p>Kalbeck finds a <i>crescendo</i> of musical psychology in the Variations,
which, as they are developed, remind him of musical dissolving views.
The seventh Variation pictures the severest test undergone by the
saint: &ldquo;The most atrocious because it is the sweetest.&rdquo; In this Siciliano
he sees the apparition of the tempting woman. The music is &ldquo;the
quintessence of human voluptuousness, which according to Master
Eckhart is &lsquo;mixed with bitterness.&rsquo; After it comes death. Blessed is the
man that has withstood the temptation! The <i>finale</i>, which includes
seventeen and more variations, celebrates him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did Brahms have all this in mind when he wrote these Variations?
Was not Kalbeck like the man &ldquo;of meager aspect with sooty hands
and face&rdquo; seen by Captain Lemuel Gulliver at the Academy of Lagado
engaged for eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams from
cucumbers?</p>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;TRAGIC&rdquo; OVERTURE, OP. 81</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Tragic</i> overture is among the greatest works of Brahms;
by its structure, and by its depths of feeling. There is no hysterical
outburst; no shrieking in despair; no peevish or sullen woe; no
obtruding suggestion of personal suffering. The German commentators
have cudgeled their brains to find a hero in the music:
Hamlet, Faust, this one, that one. They have labored in vain. The
soul of Tragedy speaks in the music.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Although the <i>Tragic</i> overture is Op. 81 and the <i>Academic</i> is Op. 80,
the <i>Tragic</i> was composed and performed before the <i>Academic</i>: it was
performed for the first time at the Fourth Philharmonic Concert at
Vienna in 1880.</p>
<p>The <i>Tragic</i> overture may be said to be a musical characterization of
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
the principles of tragedy as laid down by Aristotle or Lessing; it
mirrors, as Reimann puts it, the grandeur, the loftiness, the deep
earnestness, of tragic character; &ldquo;calamities, which an inexorable fate
has imposed on him, leave the hero guilty; the tragic downfall atones
for the guilt; this downfall, which by purifying the passions and
awakening fear and pity works on the race at large, brings expiation
and redemption to the hero himself.&rdquo; Or as Dr. Dieters says: &ldquo;In this
work we see a strong hero battling with an iron and relentless fate;
passing hopes of victory cannot alter an impending destiny. We do
not care to inquire whether the composer had a special tragedy in
his mind, or if so, which one; those who remain musically unconvinced
by the unsurpassably powerful theme, would not be assisted by a particular
suggestion.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The overture was composed in 1880 and published in 1881.</p>
<h2 id="c37"><span class="h2line1">ACADEMIC FESTIVAL OVERTURE, OP. 80</span></h2>
<p>Johannes Brahms desired to give thanks publicly to the University
of Breslau because he had received from the illustrious
dignitaries of that university the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
How best could he express his thanks in music? By something
stately, pompous? Or by something profound and cryptic? Brahms
acted with shrewdness in the matter; he took for his thematic
material well-known students&rsquo; songs. These songs are familiar
throughout Germany, and it is not as though a composer called
upon, for instance, to write an appropriate overture for an approaching
jubilee at Yale should take songs peculiar to that college;
nor is it as though a composer should take &ldquo;Eli Yale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair
Harvard&rdquo; and a Dartmouth or Williams song for his themes.
Wherever Brahms&rsquo; overture is heard by a German student, whether
of Heidelberg, Bonn, Berlin, or Breslau, the themes are old friends
and common property.</p>
<p>But where is the reckless gayety of student life in this overture?
Much of it is dry, on account of the orchestration. For even
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
when you admit that Brahms was a master builder of musical
structures, you are not thereby estopped from saying in clear, bell-like
tones that he was also color deaf.</p>
<p>The Brahmsite turns triumphantly to the <i>Fuchslied</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Was
kommt dort von der H&ouml;h&rdquo;&mdash;which is introduced by two bassoons,
accompanied by &rsquo;cellos and violas <i>pizzicati</i>. &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; he
exclaims, &ldquo;that is excruciatingly funny. Only a master, only a
Johannes could make so easily a master stroke!&rdquo; If you cross-examine
him you will find that the humor consists in the choice
of instruments.</p>
<p>Somebody once said that the bassoon is the clown of the orchestra.
Therefore the double bassoon should be twice as funny&mdash;perhaps
even a Shakespearean clown. And simply because somebody
gave the poor bassoon this name, it must be regarded as
funny <i>per se</i>. &ldquo;Funny&rdquo;? The bassoon is lugubrious, ghostly, spectral,
weird, unearthly, demoniacal. It smells of mortality. It suggests
the glow-worm and the grave. The wicked nuns in <i>Robert le Diable</i>
heard it and obeyed the spell, for corruption called to corruption.
It lends a flavor of the charnal house to Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <i>Path&eacute;tique</i>.
It pictures the mood of Leonora without Di Luna&rsquo;s tower. It chatters
and gibbers as the murderous artist in the <i>Symphonie fantastique</i>
goes his wretched way to the scaffold. It is the instrument
dear to all that inhabit the night air, the cemetery, the diseased
mind.</p>
<p>But these bassoons appear in Brahms&rsquo; overture &ldquo;<i>etwas pl&ouml;tzlich</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a
phrase I once heard used in a Berlin beer hall by a dapper and
corseted and monocled officer, who was extremely thirsty and
thus addressed the waiter. And I defy any sober-minded person
who has not the fear of Brahms before his eyes to find the introduction
or the treatment of the song spontaneously gay or humorous.
The song itself is a good freshman hazing song.</p>
<p>Some of the books&mdash;and books of authority&mdash;say that the
<i>Academic</i> was written for performance at Breslau on the occasion
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
of Brahms&rsquo; receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. He did
receive the degree, but it was on March 11, 1879, and if anyone
doubts this I shall be happy to quote to him the degree in the
original Latin&mdash;which I cannot construe, except as regards the
date. I like to think of Brahms as a doctor of philosophy. The
degree goes so well with the man. It also explains some&mdash;not all&mdash;of
his music. Let the overture be considered and weighed as the
night work of a Doctor of Philosophy.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Brahms wrote two overtures in the summer of 1880 at Ischl&mdash;the
<i>Academic</i> and the <i>Tragic</i>. They come between the Symphony in D
major and that in F major in the list of his orchestral works. It is said
by Heuberger that Brahms wrote two &ldquo;Academic Festival overtures&rdquo;;
so he must have destroyed one of them. When the <i>Academic</i> was first
played at Breslau, the rector and Senate and members of the Philosophical
faculty sat in the front seats at the performance, and the composer
conducted his work. Brahms was not a university man, but he
had known with Joachim the joyous life of students at G&ouml;ttingen&mdash;at
the university made famous by Canning&rsquo;s poem:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Whene&rsquo;er with haggard eyes I view</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>This dungeon that I&rsquo;m rotting in,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>I think of those companions true</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>who studied with me at the U-</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>niversity of G&ouml;ttingen&mdash;</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>niversity of G&ouml;ttingen</i>;</p>
</div>
<p>&mdash;the university satirized so bitterly by Heine.</p>
<p>Brahms wrote to Bernard Scholz that the title &lsquo;<i>Academic</i>&rsquo; did not
please him. Scholz suggested that it was &ldquo;cursedly academic and boresome,&rdquo;
and suggested <i>Viadrina</i>, for that was the poetical name of the
Breslau University. Brahms spoke flippantly of this overture in the fall
of 1880 to Max Kalbeck. He described it as a &ldquo;very jolly potpourri on
students&rsquo; songs &agrave; la Supp&eacute;&rdquo;; and, when Kalbeck asked him ironically
if he had used the &ldquo;Foxsong,&rdquo; he answered contentedly, &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
Kalbeck was startled, and said he could not think of such academic
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
homage to the &ldquo;leathery Herr Rektor,&rdquo; whereupon Brahms duly replied,
&ldquo;That is also wholly unnecessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first of the student songs to be introduced is Binzer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wir
hatten gebauet ein stattliches Haus&rdquo; (We had built a stately house, and
trusted in God therein through bad weather, storm, and horror). The
first measures are given out by the trumpets with a peculiarly stately
effect. The melody of &ldquo;Der Landesvater&rdquo; is given to the second violins.
And then for the first time is there any deliberate attempt to portray
the jollity of university life. The &ldquo;Fuchslied&rdquo; (Freshman Song) is
introduced suddenly by two bassoons. There are hearers undoubtedly
who remember the singing of this song in Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hyperion&rdquo;;
how the freshman entered the <i>Kneipe</i>, and was asked with ironical
courtesy concerning the health of the leathery <i>Herr Papa</i> who reads
in Cicero. Similar impertinent questions were asked concerning the
<i>Frau Mama</i> and the <i>Mamsell S&oelig;ur</i>; and then the struggle of the freshman
with the first pipe of tobacco was described in song. &ldquo;Gaudeamus
igitur,&rdquo; the melody that is familiar to students of all lands, serves
as the <i>finale</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="h2line1">CONCERTO FOR PIANOFORTE, NO. 1, IN D MINOR, OP. 15</span></h2>

<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Adagio</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Rondo: allegro non troppo</dd></dl>
<p>This concerto was played for the first time at Hanover, on January
22, 1859. Brahms was the pianist; Joachim conducted.</p>
<p>Brahms, living in Hanover in 1854, worked in the spring and summer
on a symphony. The madness of Schumann and his attempt to commit
suicide by throwing himself into the Rhine had deeply affected
him. He wrote to Joachim in January, 1855, from D&uuml;sseldorf, &ldquo;I have
been trying my hand at a symphony during the past summer, have even
orchestrated the first movement and composed the second and third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This symphony was never completed. The work as it stood was
turned into a sonata for two pianofortes. The first two movements
became later the first and the second of the Pianoforte concerto in D
minor; the third is the movement &ldquo;Behold all flesh&rdquo; in <i>A German</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
<i>Requiem</i>. The sonata for two pianofortes was frequently played in
private in the middle &rsquo;fifties by Brahms with Clara Schumann, or his
friend Julius Otto Grimm, who had assisted him in the orchestration
of the symphony. Grimm (1827-1903), philologist, conductor, lecturer,
doctor of philosophy, composer of a symphony, suites and other works,
declared that the musical contents of this sonata deserved a more dignified
form, and persuaded Brahms to put them into a concerto. The
task busied Brahms for two years or more. The movements were repeatedly
sent to Joachim, whose advice was of much assistance. In
1858 the <i>Signale</i> reported that Brahms had arrived in Detmold, and it
was hoped that some of his compositions might be performed there.
&ldquo;He has completed, among other things, a pianoforte concerto, the
great beauties of which have been reported to us.&rdquo; The musicians at
Detmold were not inclined to appreciate Brahms; it is said that the
<i>Kapellmeister</i>, Kiel, was prejudiced against him; but the concerto was
rehearsed at Hanover, and Joachim, in spite of a certain amount of
official opposition, put it on the programme of the Hanover Subscription
Court Concerts, the third of the series for 1858-59.</p>
<p>The concerto was then coldly received. The Hanover correspondent
of the <i>Signale</i> wrote, &ldquo;The work had no great success with the public,
but it aroused the decided respect and sympathy of the best musicians
for the gifted artist.&rdquo; Brahms played the concerto at a Gewandhaus
concert in Leipsic on January 27, 1859. The public and the critics were
unfriendly. The composer wrote to Joachim: &ldquo;A brilliant and decided
failure.... In spite of all this, the concerto will please some day
when I have improved its construction.&rdquo; Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel refused to
publish it; but Rieter-Biedermann gave it to the world in 1861.</p>

<p>The choice of this concerto shows the high purpose and the
pure aim; for the Second concerto of Brahms is not one to tickle
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
the ear, stun the judgment, and provoke cheap and boisterous
applause. And as the Second symphony of Brahms is to the First,
so is the Second concerto of Brahms to the First. In each case,
while the passion is less stormy, the thoughts are less crabbed and
gnarled. Only in the first movement of the B flat major concerto
does Brahms &ldquo;keep up a terrible thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second fascinates by its sturdiness and rhythmic capriciousness;
the third movement is Brahms at his noblest, when his
thought is as lofty and serenely beautiful as a summer sky at noon.
And who can describe in words the enchanting, haunting delight
of the <i>finale</i>&mdash;music like unto the perfect verse of a supreme poet
whose imagination is kindled by wild or melancholy tales told
him in youth by gypsy lips.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This concerto was performed for the first time at Budapest, from
manuscript, November 9, 1881, when the composer was the pianist.</p>
<p>On April 8, 1878, Brahms, in company with Dr. Billroth and Carl
Goldmark, made a journey to Italy. Goldmark, who went to Rome to
be present at the last rehearsals of his opera <i>Die K&ouml;nigin von Saba</i>&mdash;production
was postponed until the next year on account of the illness
of the leading soprano&mdash;did not accompany his friends to Naples and
Sicily. Returning to P&ouml;rtschach, Brahms sketched themes of the Concerto
in B flat major on the evening before his birthday; but he left
the sketches, in which &ldquo;he mirrored the Italian spring turning to summer,&rdquo;
undeveloped.</p>
<p>His violin concerto originally contained a <i>scherzo</i> movement. Conferring
with Joachim, he omitted this movement. Max Kalbeck thinks
that this <i>scherzo</i> found a home in the second pianoforte concerto.</p>
<p>In March, 1881, Brahms set out on a second journey in Italy. He
visited Venice, Florence, Siena, Orvieto, Rome, Naples, and Sicily. He
returned to Vienna on his birthday of that year with his mind full of
Italian scenes in springtime and with thoughts of the pianoforte concerto
inspired by his first visit. On May 22 he went to Pressbaum near
Vienna and lived in the villa of Mme Heingartner. In 1907, Orestes
Ritter von Connevay, then the possessor of the villa, erected a monument
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
to Brahms in the garden. A bronze bust stands on a stone pedestal.
An iron tablet bears this inscription: &ldquo;Here in the summer of 1881
Johannes Brahms completed <i>N&auml;nie</i>, Op. 82, and the pianoforte concerto,
Op. 83.&rdquo; Brahms was moved by the death of Anselm Feuerbach,
the painter, to set music for chorus and orchestra to Schiller&rsquo;s poem,
&ldquo;N&auml;nie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss May says in her life of Brahms that the manuscript of <i>N&auml;nie</i>,
and portions of the concerto, were soon lent by Brahms to Dr. Billroth,
&ldquo;the concerto movements being handed to him with the words, &lsquo;A few
little pianoforte pieces.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;It is always a delight to me,&rdquo; wrote Billroth,
&ldquo;when Brahms, after paying me a short visit, during which we have
talked of indifferent things, takes a roll out of his greatcoat pocket and
says casually, &lsquo;Look at that and write me what you think of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c40"><span class="h2line1">CONCERTO FOR VIOLIN, IN D MAJOR, OP. 77</span></h2>

<p>This concerto was written, during the summer and the fall of 1878,
at P&ouml;rtschach on Lake W&ouml;rther in Carinthia for Joseph Joachim, dedicated
to him, and first played by him under the direction of the composer
at a Gewandhaus concert, Leipsic, on January 1, 1879.</p>
<p>Brahms, not confident of his ability to write with full intelligence for
the solo violin, was aided by Joachim, who it appears from the correspondence
between him and Brahms, gave advice inspired by his own
opinions concerning the violinist&rsquo;s art. Richard Specht, in his <i>Johannes
Brahms</i> (1928), says that Brahms agreed to scarcely anything but &ldquo;bow
marks and fingering; otherwise he adhered to his text, and not always
to the advantage of his notation, which has often been misread by violinists.&rdquo;
There was a dispute concerning the writing of &ldquo;ties over staccato
dots, which has not the same meaning for the violinist as for the
pianist.&rdquo; Joachim tried to explain this difference, but Brahms obstinately
refused to alter his notation, &ldquo;which was afterwards duly misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concerto was originally in four movements. It contained a
<i>scherzo</i> which was thrown overboard. Max Kalbeck, the biographer of
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
Brahms, thinks it highly probable that it found its way into the Second
pianoforte concerto. The <i>adagio</i> was so thoroughly revised that it was
practically new. &ldquo;The middle movements have gone,&rdquo; Brahms wrote,
&ldquo;and of course they were the best! But I have written a poor <i>adagio</i>
for it.&rdquo; Specht suggests that Brahms may have intended to save the
rejected two movements for a second violin concerto, &ldquo;of which he
made sketches immediately after the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence May in her life of Brahms quotes D&ouml;rffel with regard to the
first performance at Leipsic: &ldquo;Joachim played with a love and devotion
which brought home to us in every bar the direct or indirect share he
has had in the work. As to the reception, the first movement was too
new to be distinctly appreciated by the audience, the second made
considerable way, the last aroused great enthusiasm.&rdquo; Miss May adds
that the critic Bernsdorf was less unsympathetic than usual.</p>
<p>Kalbeck, a still more enthusiastic worshiper of Brahms than Miss May,
tells a different story. &ldquo;The work was heard respectfully, but it did
not awaken a bit of enthusiasm. It seemed that Joachim had not sufficiently
studied the concerto or he was severely indisposed.&rdquo; Brahms conducted
in a state of evident excitement. A comic incident came near
being disastrous. The composer stepped on the stage in gray street
trousers, for on account of a visit he had been hindered in making a
complete change of dress. Furthermore he forgot to fasten again the
unbuttoned suspenders, so that in consequence of his lively directing
his shirt showed between his trousers and waistcoat. &ldquo;These laughter-provoking
trifles were not calculated for elevation of mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Leipsic, Brahms soon recovered his spirits. He wrote to
Elisabet von Herzogenberg from Vienna in January: &ldquo;My concert tour
was a real downhill affair after Leipsic; no more pleasure in it. Perhaps
that is a slight exaggeration, though, for friends and hospitality are not
everything on a concert tour. In some trifling ways it was even more
successful; the audiences were kinder and more alive. Joachim played
my piece more beautifully with every rehearsal, too, and the <i>cadenza</i>
went so magnificently at our concert here that the people clapped right
on into my <i>coda</i>. But what is all that compared to the privilege of going
home to Humboldtstrasse and being pulled to pieces by three womenkind&mdash;since
you object to the word &lsquo;females&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composition is fairly orthodox in form. The three movements are
separate, and the traditional <i>tuttis</i>, <i>soli</i>, <i>cadenzas</i>, etc., are pretty much
as in the old-fashioned pieces of this kind; but in the first movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
the long solo <i>cadenza</i> precedes the taking up of the first theme by the
violin. The modernity is in the prevailing spirit and in the details.
Furthermore, it is not a work for objective virtuoso display.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The orchestra which Brahms requires in his symphonies is practically the same as
that which Beethoven used in the first three movements of his Ninth: two flutes,
two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons and double bassoon, four horns, two trumpets,
three trombones, kettledrums, and strings. This is the orchestration of Brahms&rsquo;
First symphony (the trombones being reserved for the final movement). The Second
omits the double bassoon but adds a tuba. The Third lists the same orchestra
as the First. The Fourth adds a piccolo, and in this symphony the trombones are not
heard until the opening chords of the <i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>To the above basic orchestration Brahms added, in his <i>Tragic</i> overture, a piccolo
and tuba, and in his <i>Academic</i> overture, a piccolo, a third trumpet, tuba, bass drum,
cymbals, and triangle. The <i>Variations</i> add piccolo and triangle but omit trombones.
The concertos follow the usual orchestration, with but two trombones in the piano
concertos&mdash;none in the violin concerto.&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<h2 id="c41"><span class="h2line1">ANTON</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">BRUCKNER</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Ansfelden, in Upper Austria, September 4, 1824; died at Vienna, October 11, 1896)</p>
<p>Both the admirers of Bruckner and those that dislike his music
lay stress on the fact that he was born a peasant and was essentially
a peasant to the day of his death, although the Rector Magnificus
of the University of Vienna bowed before him when he presented
him with the honorary degree of doctor. The detractors find in
Bruckner&rsquo;s peasanthood his salient faults. The former say that by
reason of the simplicity and purity of his character Bruckner was
as Paul caught up in the body or out of the body, they cannot
tell, to the third heaven, caught up into paradise where he heard
unspeakable words, which it was not lawful for him to utter, but
it was allowed him to hint at them in music. The latter insist that
his peasant na&iuml;vet&eacute; is revealed in his interminable chatter, in his
vague wanderings, in his lack of continuity and cohesion in the
expression of thought.</p>
<p>The wretched game of politics is still played with Bruckner.
Because he worshipped Wagner and because Brahms, or rather
Hanslick&mdash;who was to Brahms both elephantier and thurifer&mdash;was
opposed to Wagner, the Wagnerites therefore pitted Bruckner
against Brahms and proclaimed the former the great successor to
Beethoven in the field of absolute music. As a matter of fact,
Brahms was neither bitterly hostile toward Wagner nor did he
sneer at Bruckner. There was room for both Brahms and Bruckner&mdash;except
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
in Vienna and except in the shaggy breasts of Wagnerites.
Hanslick is dead, &ldquo;the executioner of Bruckner,&rdquo; as William Ritter
characterizes him, &ldquo;the man who derided all the true glories of
the music of his time for Brahms&rsquo; sole benefit&rdquo;; but Hanslick in
his lifetime did not kill Bruckner, who had friendly audiences in
Vienna before his death, whose fame has steadily grown.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate fully and yet with discrimination the
indisputable talent, the irregular, uncontrolled genius of Bruckner,
it is not necessary to inquire curiously into Bruckner&rsquo;s humble
origins, or into the character of his father and mother. It was the
theory of Sainte-Beuve that the superior man is found, at least in
part, in his parents, and especially in his mother; but I doubt in
this instance whether an intimate acquaintance with Therese, the
daughter of the innkeeper and administrator Ferdinand Helm, at
Neuzeng, would explain the inconsistencies and contradictions in
her son&rsquo;s music. She was no doubt a strong, lusty woman, and she
bore her husband a dozen children. As for Bruckner being a
peasant, poor, now rude in behavior and speech, and now almost
cringing in his desire to be courteous, shabbily educated, very few
of the greatest composers have been born in rooms of purple
hangings, very few have been distinguished for the elegance of
their manners or the depth and breadth of their general learning.</p>
<p>The wonder is that Bruckner, the long-ignored, poor, humble
school teacher, grotesque in appearance, a peasant in speech and
action, should have had apocalyptic visions and spoken musically
with the tongues of angels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>

<p>This certainly is a gigantic work, abounding in lofty and noble
pages, abounding also in trivialities, tiresome repetitions, and fussy
and insignificant details. As in the other symphonies of Bruckner
that we have heard, there is a lack of continuity in each movement;
there are impressive preparations that lead to nothing: &ldquo;In
the name of the Prophet&mdash;Figs!&rdquo; The composer had little sense
of structure. To use Disraeli&rsquo;s phrase, he was intoxicated with his
own verbosity. His taste in ornamentation was more than doubtful.
He could crown a noble fa&ccedil;ade with gingerbread work; he
would plan an extension of cheap stucco to a pure temple of
marble.</p>
<p>And yet in the Seventh symphony there are pages that come
closer to Beethoven at his greatest than we find in the symphonies
of other composers. There are grand thoughts expressed in a
masterly manner in Franck&rsquo;s symphony and in the symphony in
B flat by Vincent d&rsquo;Indy; the introduction to the <i>finale</i> of Brahms&rsquo;
First symphony has elemental grandeur and spiritual intensity;
but Bruckner&rsquo;s spirit in the <i>adagio</i> and in the main body of the
<i>scherzo</i> of the Seventh symphony is nearer akin to that of Beethoven.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Bruckner&rsquo;s Symphony in E major was composed in the time between
September, 1881, and September, 1883. The first movement was completed
December 29, 1882; the third, October 16, 1882; the fourth, September
5, 1883. The symphony is dedicated &ldquo;To His Majesty the King,
Ludwig II of Bavaria, in deepest reverence,&rdquo; and was published in 1885.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>The statement is often made that the <i>adagio</i> was composed as funeral
music in memory of Richard Wagner. As a matter of fact, this <i>adagio</i>
was completed in October, 1882. Wagner died February 13, 1883.</p>
<p>The singular statement has been made that a premonition of Wagner&rsquo;s
death inspired Bruckner to compose a dirge&mdash;this <i>adagio</i>. Bruckner,
who had what the Germans call &ldquo;peasant cunning,&rdquo; may have
agreed to this in the presence of those who were thus affected by the
thought, but he himself knew, as will be seen by his letters to Felix
Mottl in 1885 concerning the first performance at Carlsruhe, that the
movement had not in all respects the character of a dirge. Indeed, he
pointed out the measures of the funeral music: &ldquo;At X in the <i>adagio</i>
(Funeral music for tubas and horns)&rdquo; etc.; also, &ldquo;Please take a very
slow and solemn tempo. At the close, in the Dirge (In memory of the
death of the Master), think of our Ideal!... Kindly do not forget the
<i>fff</i> at the end of the Dirge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruckner wrote to Mottl in a letter published February 10, 1900:
&ldquo;At one time I came home and was very sad; I thought to myself, it is
impossible that the Master can live for a long time, and then the <i>adagio</i>
in C sharp minor came into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two
bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, four Wagner
tubas, bass tuba, kettledrums, triangle, cymbals, strings.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro moderato</i>, E major, 2-2. The first theme is announced by
horn and violoncellos against the violins, tremolo, and clarinets, violas,
and violoncellos add a subsidiary theme. The chief theme appears in a
richer orchestral dress. There is a <i>crescendo</i> based on the subsidiary
theme, and the whole orchestra enters, but there is quickly a <i>diminuendo</i>,
and the mood becomes more nervous, more uncertain. The
second theme, one of complaint, is given to oboe and clarinet, with
horns and trumpet in the accompaniment. This theme with its peculiar
instrumentation and its changing tonality is in marked opposition to
the first. This second chief theme is developed at length. (The first
assumes greater importance later.) In this development there are evidences
in the manner of leading the voices of Bruckner&rsquo;s partiality for
the organ. The mood becomes more restful, although the theme of
complaint is not silent, but soon appears, inverted, in the violins. It
may here be said that Bruckner delighted in this manner of varying a
theme. A mighty <i>crescendo</i> is based on a phrase of this inverted theme
over an organ-point, F sharp, but instead of the arrival of the expected
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
climax a theme of somewhat mournful character is given to wood-wind
instruments with counterpoint in the strings. The rhythm of this
counterpoint is maintained in the final section of the exposition part.
An episode for the brass follows. There is soon a calmer mood, and
gentle horn and clarinet tones mingle with the voices of the strings.</p>
<p>The free fantasia begins with an inversion of the first theme (clarinet).
The rhythm of the characteristic counterpoint just mentioned appears,
but a solemn, religious mood is soon established (trombones,
<i>pianissimo</i>). The second chief theme appears in its inverted form, also
the &ldquo;contrapuntal figure.&rdquo; The mood is now one of doubt and perplexity,
but the decisive, inexorable first theme enters, inverted, C
minor, in the full orchestra, <i>fortissimo</i>, and with canonic imitation.</p>
<p>The beginning of the third, or recapitulation, part of the movement is
quietly worked. The first theme appears <i>piano</i> (violoncellos and horn);
there is an inversion of the theme for violins and flute, and there is
canonic imitation for oboe and trumpet. As in the first part, the subsidiary
leads to the second chief theme, which is now in E minor and
is given to the clarinet. There is an end to the delicate instrumentation.
There is a great <i>crescendo</i>, which ends in an inversion of the second
chief theme, <i>fortissimo</i>, for full orchestra. Other <i>crescendos</i> follow, one
with the second theme to an episode of choral character, others based on
the &ldquo;contrapuntal figure.&rdquo; The great climax comes in the elaborate <i>coda</i>,
which is built on a long organ-point on the bass E, with the first
subsidiary theme and with the first chief theme, which now has its true
and heroic character.</p>
<p>II. <i>Adagio, sehr feierlich und langsam</i> (in a very solemn and slow
manner), C sharp minor, 4-4. This movement is thought by many to
be Bruckner&rsquo;s masterpiece and monument. It undoubtedly established
his fame when there were few to recognize his irregular genius.
The <i>adagio</i> was played in cities of Germany in memory of the composer
shortly after his death, as at the Philharmonic Concert, Berlin,
led by Mr. Nikisch, October 26, 1896.</p>
<p>In this movement, as in the <i>finale</i>, Bruckner introduced the Bayreuth
tubas, to gain effects of peculiar solemnity and also, no doubt,
to pay homage to the master whom he loved and venerated.</p>
<p>The chief melody of the <i>adagio</i> is given to the lower strings and
tubas and is answered by all the strings.</p>
<p>There is a passage of stormy lamentation, and then consolation comes
in a melody for violins (<i>moderato</i>, F sharp major, 3-4). This theme is
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
developed, chiefly by the strings. Then there is a return to the first
and solemn theme, with wood-wind instruments and strings in alternation.
There is a great <i>crescendo</i> with bold modulations until the
entrance, C major, of the chief theme (second violins, supported by
horn, oboes, and clarinets), which is soon followed by a variant of
the answer to this theme. The answer soon appears in E flat major
and in its original form and is maintained for a long time (G major).
There is a modulation to A flat major, and the <i>cantilena</i> is repeated.
After the entrance again of the chief melody and the restoration of the
original tonality there is a <i>crescendo</i> of great and imposing force. This
is over, and the tubas chant the answer to the chief theme and after an
interlude for strings the chief theme itself, C sharp major. The horns
take up the <i>cantilena</i>, and the last chord, C sharp major, dies away in
brass instruments to a <i>pizzicato</i> of the strings.</p>
<p>III. <i>Scherzo</i>: <i>sehr schnell</i> (very fast), A minor, 3-4. This <i>scherzo</i> is
based chiefly on two themes&mdash;the first for trumpet (<i>piano</i>), then clarinet,
with a figure for strings; the second, a wild and raging one. The
<i>scherzo</i> ends after a great <i>crescendo</i>. Drumbeats lead to the trio, F
major, <i>etwas langsamer</i> (somewhat slower), with an expressive melody
for strings. The theme of this trio is made at first out of an inversion
of the <i>scherzo</i> theme, but the trio is in all respects in marked contrast
to the <i>scherzo</i>, which after the trio is repeated.</p>
<p><i>Finale</i>: <i>bewegt, doch nicht schnell</i> (with movement, but not fast),
E major, 2-2. The first theme, given to the violins, has a certain
resemblance, as far as intervals are concerned, to the chief theme of
the first movement, but it is joyous rather than impressive. Flutes and
clarinets enter at times, and horn tones also enter and lead to the
second theme, which has the character of a choral, with an accompanying
<i>pizzicato</i> bass. The tubas are then heard in solemn chords. A new
theme of a dreamy nature follows (strings), and then at the beginning
of the free fantasia an orchestral storm breaks loose. This dies away,
and a theme appears which is derived from the first and main motive,
which in turn enters, inverted, and with a <i>pizzicato</i> bass. The choral
theme is also inverted, but it gives way to the chief motive, which is
developed and leads to another tempestuous burst, ended suddenly
with a pause for the whole orchestra. The repetition section brings
back the themes in inverted order. The second chief theme is heard in
C major. After a time there is a <i>crescendo</i> built on passages of this
motive, which leads to a powerful episode in B major, with a theme in
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
the bass derived from the chief motive. This motive is given to violins
and clarinets, and there are contrapuntal imitations. The choral theme,
appearing at the end of the free fantasia, is heard no more. The first
chief theme dominates to the end. There is an imposing <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>I am indebted in a measure to the analysis of this symphony by Mr.
Johannes Reichert, prepared for the concerts of the Royal Orchestra
of Dresden.</p>

<p>Bruckner&rsquo;s Eighth is in all respects to be numbered with his
greatest. The structure is nobler, the form more clearly recognized
than in his other symphonies. There is less perplexing or boresome
detail. The digressions do not cause the main line of musical
argument to be forgotten. The interest is more steadily maintained.
The instrumentation is richer in color and in contrasts. Above all,
the invention shown, both in thematic lines and in wealth of
development, is little less than marvelous, for Bruckner was sixty
years old when he began work on this symphony.</p>
<p>Much has been said in European cities about the extraordinary
length of the work. This length does not seem distressing. Bruckner
had a great deal to say, and whereas in other symphonies he
sometimes stammers and often falters, as though he were not
able to express his thoughts, as though they were so great to him
that he hesitated to put them into even musical speech, which
comes nearest to the full expression of the inherently inexpressible,
in this symphony he is master of his speech; he is convincing,
authoritative, eloquent. Furthermore, he is more discriminative
in his use of material. In other symphonies he is seen building
indifferently with marble and clay. His Eighth symphony is as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
stately temple, in which mortals forget the paltry cares and tribulations
of earth, and gods appear calm and benignant.</p>
<p>There are pages that remind one of the visions seen by John
on the isle of Patmos. &ldquo;And I heard, as it were, the voice of a
great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice
of mighty thunderings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are also pages of ravishing beauty, as those of the trio
in the <i>scherzo</i>, as those devoted to the exposition of the first and
second themes of the <i>adagio</i>, as those of the second theme in the
<i>finale</i>. The <i>scherzo</i>, with rough humor and its episode of rare
melodic beauty finely orchestrated, is of this earth, but the other
movements leave the earth behind in a sustained and fearless flight.
This is especially true of the first movement and the <i>adagio</i>.</p>
<p>In the <i>finale</i> there is here and there a drooping of the wings,
but the opening measures of this <i>finale</i> and the close are towering
and exultant.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, begun in 1885, was completed in 1890. It was performed
for the first time in Vienna, December 18, 1892, at a Philharmonic
concert led by Hans Richter. Even Hanslick admitted in his
bitter review (<i>Neue Freie Presse</i>, December 23, 1892) of the symphony
that the concert was a triumph for the composer. &ldquo;How was the
new symphony received? Boisterous rejoicing, waving of handkerchiefs
from those standing, innumerable recalls, laurel wreaths,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The symphony is dedicated to the composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;imperial and royal
apostolic Majesty Francis Joseph I, Emperor of Austria and apostolic
King of Hungary.&rdquo; It is scored for three flutes, three oboes, three clarinets,
three bassoons (and double bassoon), eight horns, three trumpets,
three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, triangle, cymbals, three harps,
and usual strings.</p>
<p>It appears that, when the symphony was first performed, there was
an explanatory programme written by some devout disciple. This programme
stated that the first theme of the first movement was &ldquo;the form
of the &AElig;schylean Prometheus&rdquo;; and a portion of this movement was
entitled &ldquo;the greatest loneliness and silence.&rdquo; The <i>scherzo</i> was supposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
to typify &ldquo;The German Michael.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Der deutsche Michel</i>&rdquo; may be translated
&ldquo;the plain, honest, much enduring (but slow) German,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Michel&rdquo; in a figurative sense means yokel, boor, clodhopper. Hanslick
wrote: &ldquo;If a critic had spoken this blasphemy, he would probably have
been stoned to death by Bruckner&rsquo;s disciples; but the composer himself
gave this name, the German Michael, to the <i>scherzo</i>, as may be read
in black and white in the programme.&rdquo; The published score bears
no motto. The programme-maker found in the <i>scherzo</i> &ldquo;the deeds and
sufferings of Prometheus reduced in the way of parody to the smallest
proportions.&rdquo; And in the <i>adagio</i> was disclosed &ldquo;the all-loving Father of
mankind in his measureless wealth of mercy.&rdquo; The <i>finale</i> was characterized
by him as &ldquo;heroism in the service of the Divine,&rdquo; and the trumpet
calls in the <i>finale</i> were explained as &ldquo;the announcers of eternal salvation,
heralds of the idea of divinity.&rdquo; On the other hand, it is said that
the beginning of the <i>finale</i> was suggested to Bruckner by the meeting
of the three emperors!</p>
<p>In the published score there is nothing to give the idea that the
music has any programme, any argument. Yet Johannes Reichert in
his analysis<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> of the symphony, referring to Josef Schalk&rsquo;s vision of
&ldquo;Prometheus Bound&rdquo; in the first movement, found something of
Prometheus or of Faust in the music.</p>
<p class="tb">I. <i>Allegro moderato</i>, C minor, 2-2. The first and chief motive is
given to violas, violoncellos, and double basses. It is announced <i>pianissimo</i>;
it is decisively rhythmed, and its rhythm and its upward leap of
a sixth are important factors in the development. After a short <i>crescendo</i>,
the strings are about to return to a <i>pianissimo</i> when the theme is proclaimed
with the full force of the orchestra.</p>
<p>The first violins have the expressive and questioning second theme.
Wood-wind instruments answer the question. The rhythm of the second
theme, a rhythm that is characteristically Brucknerian, is used in
counterpoint to a new <i>cantilena</i> sung by horns and first violins.</p>
<p>There is a modulation to the dominant of the chief tonality. The
second theme now assumes an obstinate, arrogant character. Wood-wind
instruments conduct over <i>pianissimo</i> and sustained chords of
tubas, with the use of the first measures of the chief motive, to the
second subsidiary section. In spite of the interrupting springs of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
seventh there is a return to a quiet mood. Then comes a chromatic and
mighty <i>crescendo</i> for full orchestra, which reaches a climax with trumpet
fanfares. The chief motive returns and is given out thrice <i>pianissimo</i>.
The first horn has the chief motive in augmentation, and there is a
double echo of it: from first oboe; from tenor tuba.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;working-out&rdquo; section begins with the indication &ldquo;very quietly.&rdquo;
Oboes and tubas introduce constituent parts of the chief motive in
augmentation; then the motive itself appears in inversion and as in a
<i>stretto</i>. This form of elaboration is long continued. And now the second
theme appears inverted, and gives with its compelling rhythm the
impetus to a great crescendo which reaches its climax with the encounter
of the two themes <i>fortississimo</i>. This shock occurs three times without
a decisive result. The orchestra seems to lose its force. There are wandering
fragments of the two motives, while the trumpet keeps up monotonously
the rhythm of the chief theme. A fragment of the first theme
leads to the repetition section.</p>
<p>The repetition is at first free, whereas as a rule in Bruckner&rsquo;s symphonies
it is literal. The first theme, now a lamentation, is given to the first
oboe. The clarinet answers in another tonality. After bold modulations
the second theme is repeated. The prevailing mood of unrest ends with
a long held <i>fermata</i>. The second subsidiary section is repeated quietly,
and, as in the first chief section of the movement, it is used in a <i>crescendo</i>;
but here the climax is built on a <i>coda</i> motive of a bitterly complaining
character, while horns and trumpets repeat incessantly the
chief theme. Grief itself soon loses its voice. The violins sigh the chief
motive thrice <i>pianissimo</i>. Only the last portion of the theme is then
heard, and it dies away in the violas.</p>
<p>II. <i>Scherzo</i>, <i>Allegro moderato</i>, C minor, 3-4. The chief theme (violas
and violoncellos) has a rough humor, while violins have a contrasting
figure of a whispering and mysterious nature. This figure brings in a
great <i>crescendo</i> in which the theme is blown by horns, later by trumpets,
and at last by the bass tuba. At the end of the section a rhythm appears
(E flat major, bassoons, drums, basses) that is slightly reminiscent of
a rhythm in Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony No. 8. The whispering figure is
inverted. The first section is repeated.</p>
<p>The trio begins <i>langsam</i> (&ldquo;slow&rdquo;), 2-4, softly and delicately (first
violins). The horn enters. There are pleasant harmonies in E major.
&ldquo;The whole episode breathes smiling happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The harp is used here and in the <i>adagio</i>, the only instances of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
use of this instrument in a symphony by Bruckner. A second subject
brings the return to A flat major. The beginning of the trio is repeated
with changes in tonality, and the whole first part of the <i>scherzo</i> is repeated
with an ending in C major.</p>
<p>III. The <i>adagio</i> is said to be probably the longest symphonic <i>adagio</i>
movement in existence, and there are some that put it at the head
of all <i>adagios</i> by reason of its solemnity, nobility, and elevated
thought. It begins, &ldquo;solemn, slow, but not dragging,&rdquo; D flat major,
4-4. The first violins sing (on the G string) a long and intimate song
to the accompaniment of the second violins and lower strings. &ldquo;This
theme contains three moments of mood. For the first four measures the
violins complain softly; then sighing clarinets and bassoons enter in
gasps; the four last measures are only an extension to strengthen the
mood.&rdquo; A strange organ-point puts an end to the mood of doubt and
brings in triumphant certainty. The violins, playing with greater
breadth, lead to a calm close in F. There is a repetition of what has
gone before, with the exception of a few measures of the chief theme.</p>
<p>The second theme is sung by the violoncellos, and they lead to the
serenely quiet song of the tubas. Some measures based on fragments
of the second theme bring in the &ldquo;working-out&rdquo; section. The chief theme
appears. Portions of the long <i>cantilena</i> are combined, and there is fresh
and melodic counterpoint. There is at the same time a <i>crescendo</i>. After
the climax the second theme becomes prominent, with interruptions
by the tubas.</p>
<p>The first theme appears with lively figuration at the beginning of
the second section of development. A portion of this theme is used in
augmentation. &ldquo;Then appears suddenly and in a decided manner the
rhythm for horns of the &lsquo;Siegfried&rsquo; motive in <i>The Ring</i>.&rdquo; The accompaniment
for strings grows livelier; the chief theme is more and more
impressive in the brass. The second theme enters, and there are
tranquillizing episodes, but there is no checking the course of the
<i>crescendo</i> or the acceleration in pace. &ldquo;<i>&Agrave; tempo</i> (though in a lively
movement).&rdquo; The third section of the chief theme is now in powerful
augmentation. There is a return to the prevailing tempo. The mood is
milder. The violins &ldquo;intimately and softly&rdquo; remember once more the
second theme. The <i>coda</i> brings in a peaceful close. In the third and
fourth measures before the end the tubas indicate <i>pianissimo</i> the
chief rhythm of the <i>finale</i> that follows.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale</i>, C minor, &ldquo;solemnly, not fast,&rdquo; 2-2. The heavily rhythmed
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
chief theme contains three important motives. It first appears in F sharp,
as the enharmonically changed subdominant of the preceding tonality,
D flat major (or as the dominant of the dominant of C minor). Joyful
fanfares sound in D flat. The whole is repeated, and there is a
modulation from A flat to E flat. Then appears sonorously the conclusion
of the whole theme in the prevailing tonality, C minor. Out of
the counterpoint arises a lamenting strain for oboes.</p>
<p>There is a pause. The melodious and religious second theme is sung
in slower tempo. The accompanying voices for horn and violas might
well be reckoned as thematic. The third theme, wood-wind and
strings, is practically a double theme, and the lower voice has much
importance later. The concluding section of this theme is developed
in choral fashion, and it is then combined with the lower voice. After
a pause comes the working-out section. As the introduction indicated,
it gives the impression of a mighty struggle. A blend of the two just
preceding themes leads to a new melody for violins. There is a powerful
<i>crescendo</i> for full orchestra. The rhythm of the chief theme of the
first movement is heard. The first measures of the <i>finale</i> are now played
softly by the horns, then by the flutes. Preceding themes are again
combined. The repetition section opens powerfully. The decisive rhythm
of the chief theme spurs the full orchestra. The <i>coda</i> begins quietly,
but it soon becomes intense. In the triumphant ending in C major,
chief themes of the four movements are heard exulting.</p>
<p>I am indebted in a measure for the preceding sketch of the contents
of this symphony to the analysis by Werner Wolff, published in the
programme book of the Philharmonic Orchestra, Berlin, October 29,
1906; and to the analysis of Johannes Reichert which has already
been mentioned. They that wish to study the symphony may consult
with profit the analysis by Willibald K&auml;hler (<i>Musikf&uuml;hrer</i> No. 262).
These analysts are by no means unanimous in their designation of
the chief themes. I have followed chiefly in the footsteps of Mr. Wolff.</p>
<p class="tb">It may help to a better understanding of the music of Bruckner if
light be thrown on the personal nature and prejudices not only of the
composer but of his contemporaneous partisans and foes. This simple
man, who had known the cruelest poverty and distress, and in Vienna
lived the life of an ascetic, made enemies by the very writing of
music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>There appeared in Vienna in 1901 a little pamphlet entitled <i>Meine
Erinnerung an Anton Bruckner</i>. The writer was Carl Hruby, a pupil
of Bruckner. The pamphlet is violent, malignant. In its rage there is
at times the ridiculous fury of an excited child. There are pages that
provoke laughter and then pity; yet there is much of interest about the
composer himself, who now, away from strife and contention, is still
unfortunate in his friends. We shall pass over Hruby&rsquo;s ideas on music
and the universe, nor are we inclined to dispute his proposition (p. 7)
that Shakespeare, Goethe, Beethoven, Wagner, were truer heroes and
supporters of civilization than Alexander, C&aelig;sar, Napoleon, who,
nevertheless, were, like Hannibal, very pretty fellows in those days.
When Hruby begins to talk about Bruckner and his ways, then it is
time to prick up ears.</p>
<p>As a teacher, Bruckner was amiable, patient, kind, but easily vexed
by frolicsome pupils who did not know his sensitive nature. He gave
each pupil a nickname, and his favorite phrase of contentment and
disapproval was &ldquo;<i>Viechkerl!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You stupid beast!&rdquo; There was a young
fellow whose name began &ldquo;Sachsen&rdquo;; but Bruckner could never remember
the rest of it, so he would go through the list of German princes,
&ldquo;Sachsen&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sachsen&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha, Sachsen&rdquo;&mdash;and at last
the name would come. Another pupil, afterwards a harp virtuoso,
was known to his teacher only as &ldquo;Old Harp.&rdquo; Bruckner had a rough,
at the same time, sly, peasant humor. One of his pupils came into the
class with bleached and jaded face. Bruckner asked what ailed him.
The answer was: &ldquo;I was at the Turnverein till two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said Bruckner, &ldquo;oh, yes, I know the Turnverein that lasts till 2 <span class="small">A.M.</span>&rdquo;
The pupil on whom he built fond hope was Franz Nott, who died
young and in the madhouse. When Bruckner was disturbed in his work,
he was incredibly and gloriously rude.</p>
<p>Bruckner was furious against all writers who discovered &ldquo;programmes&rdquo;
in his music. He was warmly attached to the ill-fated Hugo
Wolf, and was never weary of praising the declamation in his songs:
&ldquo;The fellow does nothing all day but compose, while I must tire myself
out by giving lessons,&rdquo; for at sixty years Bruckner was teaching for
three guldens a lesson. Beethoven was his idol, and after a performance
of one of the greater symphonies he was as one insane. After a performance
of the <i>Eroica</i>, he said to Hruby&mdash;would that it were possible
to reproduce Bruckner&rsquo;s dialect&mdash;&ldquo;I think that if Beethoven were alive,
and I should go to him with my Seventh symphony and say, &lsquo;Here,
Mr. Van Beethoven, this is not so bad, this Seventh, as certain gentlemen
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
would make out&rsquo; ... I think he would take me by the hand and
say, &lsquo;My dear Bruckner, never mind, I had no better luck; and the
same men who hold me up against you even now do not understand
my last quartets, although they act as if they understood them.&rsquo; Then
I&rsquo;d say to him, &lsquo;Excuse me, Mr. Van Beethoven, that I have gone beyond
you in freedom of form, but I think a true artist should make his own
forms for his own works, and stick by them.&rsquo;&rdquo; He once said of Hanslick,
&ldquo;I guess Hanslick understands as little about Brahms as about
Wagner, me, and others. And the Doctor Hanslick knows as much
about counterpoint as a chimney sweep about astronomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanslick was to Bruckner as a pursuing demon. (We are giving
Hruby&rsquo;s statement, and Hanslick surely showed a strange perseverance
and an unaccountable ferocity in criticism that was abuse.) Hruby
likens this critic to the <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i> in the vineyard. He really
believes that Hanslick sat up at night to plot Bruckner&rsquo;s destruction.
He affirms that Hanslick tried to undermine him in the Conservatory
and the Imperial Chapel, that he tried to influence conductors against
the performance of his works. And he goes so far as to say that Hans
Richter, thus influenced, had never performed a symphony by Bruckner
in England. As a matter of fact, Richter produced Bruckner&rsquo;s
Seventh in London, May 23, 1887. There is a story that when the
Emperor Franz Josef asked Bruckner if he could honor him in any
way, he asked if the Emperor would not stop Hanslick abusing him
in print.</p>
<p>He was never mean or hostile toward Brahms, as some would have
had him. He once said that Brahms was not an enemy of Wagner, as
the Brahmsites insisted; that down in his heart he had a warm admiration
for Wagner, as was shown by the praise he had bestowed on
<i>Die Meistersinger</i>.</p>
<p>Just before his death Bruckner&rsquo;s thoughts were on his Ninth symphony:
&ldquo;I undertook a stiff task,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should not have done
it at my age and in my weak condition. If I never finish it, then my
&lsquo;<i>Te Deum</i>&rsquo; may be used as a <i>finale</i>. I have nearly finished three movements.
This work belongs to my Lord God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he had the religion of a child, he had read the famous
book of David Strauss, and he could talk about it reasonably. Someone
asked him about the future life and prayer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;If the story is true, so much the better for me. If it is not true,
praying cannot hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Carpenter has told us in music the outing of a child. One
of his first compositions was a collection of humorous <i>Improving
Songs for Children</i>. This fondness for children as subjects for art
he shares with Victor Hugo; with Swinburne, who abandoned
the shrine of Venus to sing of children&rsquo;s beauty and innocence&mdash;after
Watts-Dunton had docked him of his rum. In the <i>Perambulator</i>
there is no sentimentalism, no Sunday-school address to &ldquo;you,
little girl with the blue sash&rdquo;; but his music is as his child saw and
thought, when wheeled about.</p>
<p class="tb">This suite is not only an ingenious work: it has true fancy, true
humor, pages of truly poetic feeling. Mr. Carpenter displays
imagination; witness his glorification of the lake that supplies
Chicago with water. But even his imagination was dormant at the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
thought of the Chicago River. An unflinching realist would have
introduced the child&rsquo;s visit to the stockyards and slaughter houses.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The composition of this suite was begun in July, 1914, and completed
in December of that year. The suite was performed for the first time
at the concerts of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Frederick Stock
conductor, March 19-20, 1915.</p>
<p>The suite is scored for these instruments: three flutes (and piccolo),
two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons,
four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, bass
drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, xylophone, glockenspiel, bells,
harp, celesta, pianoforte, and the usual strings.</p>
<p>This programme is printed as preface to the score:</p>
<p>I. <i>En Voiture.</i> Every morning&mdash;after my second breakfast&mdash;if the
wind and the sun are favorable, I go out. I should like to go alone, but
my will is overborne. My nurse is appointed to take me. She is older
than I, and very powerful. While I wait for her, resigned, I hear her
cheerful steps, always the same. I am wrapped in a vacuum of wool,
where there are no drafts. A door opens and shuts. I am placed in my
perambulator, a strap is buckled over my stomach, my nurse stands
firmly behind&mdash;and we are off!</p>
<p>II. <i>The Policeman.</i> Out is wonderful! It is always different, though
one seems to have been there before. I cannot fathom it all. Some
sounds seem like smells. Some sights have echoes. It is confusing, but
it is Life! For instance, the Policeman&mdash;an Unprecedented Man! Round
like a ball; taller than my Father. Blue&mdash;fearful&mdash;fascinating! I feel him
before he comes. I see him after he goes. I try to analyze his appeal.
It is not buttons alone, nor belt, nor baton. I suspect it is his eye and
the way he walks. He walks like Doom. My nurse feels it, too. She
becomes less firm, less powerful. My perambulator hurries, hesitates,
and stops. They converse. They ask each other questions&mdash;some with
answers, some without. I listen, with discretion. When I feel that they
have gone far enough, I signal to my nurse, a private signal, and the
Policeman resumes his enormous Blue March. He is gone, but I feel him
after he goes.</p>
<p>III. <i>The Hurdy-gurdy.</i> Then suddenly there is something else. I think
it is a sound. We approach it. My ear is tickled to excess. I find that
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
the absorbing noise comes from a box&mdash;something like my music box,
only much larger, and on wheels. A dark man is turning the music
out of the box with a handle, just as I do with mine. A dark lady,
richly dressed, turns when the man gets tired. They both smile. I smile
too, with restraint, for music is the most insidious form of noise. And
such music! So gay! I tug at the strap over my stomach. I have a wild
thought of dancing with my nurse and my perambulator&mdash;all three of
us together. Suddenly, at the climax of our excitement, I feel the
approach of a phenomenon that I remember. It is the Policeman. He
has stopped the music. He has frightened away the dark man and the
lady with their music box. He seeks the admiration of my nurse
for his act. He walks away, his buttons shine, but far off I hear again
the forbidden music. Delightful forbidden music!</p>
<p>IV. <i>The Lake.</i> Sated with adventure, my nurse firmly pushes me on,
and before I recover my balance I am face to face with new excitement.
The land comes to an end, and there at my feet is the Lake. All other
sensations are joined in one. I see, I hear, I feel the quiver of the little
waves as they escape from the big ones and come rushing up over
the sand. Their fear is pretended. They know the big waves are amiable,
for they can see a thousand sunbeams dancing with impunity on their
very backs. Waves and sunbeams! Waves and sunbeams! Blue water&mdash;white
clouds&mdash;dancing, swinging! A white sea gull floating in the air.
That is <i>My Lake</i>!</p>
<p>V. <i>Dogs.</i> We pass on. Probably there is nothing more in the World.
If there is, it is superfluous. <i>There</i> IS. It is Dogs! We are coming upon
them without warning. Not <i>one</i> of them&mdash;all of them. First, one by
one; then in pairs; then in societies. Little dogs, with sisters; big dogs,
with aged parents. Kind dogs, brigand dogs, sad dogs, and gay. They
laugh, they fight, they run. And at last, in order to hold my interest,
the very littlest brigand starts a game of &ldquo;Follow the Leader,&rdquo; followed
by all the others. It is tremendous!</p>
<p>VI. <i>Dreams.</i> Those dogs have gone! It is confusing, but it is Life!
My mind grows numb. My cup is too full. I have a sudden conviction
that it is well that I am not alone. That firm step behind reassures
me. The wheels of my perambulator make a sound that quiets my
nerves. I lie very still. I am quite content. In order to think more
clearly, I close my eyes. My thoughts are absorbing. I deliberate upon
my mother. Most of the time my mother and my nurse have but one
identity in my mind, but at night or when I close my eyes, I can easily
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
tell them apart, for my mother has the greater charm, I hear her voice
quite plainly now, and feel the touch of her hand. It is pleasant to
live over again the adventures of the day&mdash;the long blue waves curling
in the sun, the Policeman who is bigger than my father, the music-box
and my friends, the Dogs. It is pleasant to lie quite still and close my
eyes, and listen to the wheels of my perambulator. How very large
the world is! How many things there are!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<h2 id="c46"><span class="h2line1">CLAUDE ACHILLE</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DEBUSSY</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Germain [Seine and Oise], August 22, 1862; died at Paris, March 26, 1918)</p>
<p>Debussy suffered at the hands of the ultra-orthodox and the
snobs in music. The former could not find either melodic lines
or the semblance of form in his orchestral and chamber works,
his songs and pianoforte pieces. The snobs, secretly bored, thought
it the thing to swoon at the mere mention of his name. In New
York and Boston, as in Paris, there were &ldquo;<i>Pell&eacute;astres</i>,&rdquo; to use the
contemptuous term coined by Jean Lorraine. There were some
that spoke of Debussy as an ignorant fellow who, not being able
to achieve greatness in the conventional manner, wrote in an
eccentric way to attract attention, to make the bourgeois sit up.
They forgot that Debussy had taken the chief prize at the Paris
Conservatory, where harmony and counterpoint are taught rigorously.
Debussy fashioned his own musical speech. It is easy to say
that he learned much from Moussorgsky&rsquo;s <i>Boris Godounov</i>&mdash;but
no one has yet pointed out exactly what he borrowed or imitated.
That Debussy sojourned in Russia was enough to excite those who
are unwilling to admit that any innovator has originality, for
Debussy was an innovator, not a developer of what was handed
down to him. It is more probable that he learned from the gypsies
in Russia than from Moussorgsky.</p>
<p>The question arises whether in his compositions of the few last
years Debussy did not merely imitate himself, whether he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
anything more to say. The believer in plenary inspiration of
course shouts with joy on hearing the three sonatas that have been
played in this country. Admiring Debussy greatly as we do, we
cannot in this instance shout with him. Debussy can surely rest
his fame on the string quartet; <i>L&rsquo;Apr&egrave;s-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i>; <i>Gigues</i>,
<i>Ib&eacute;ria</i>, <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>, and some of the songs and the pianoforte
pieces.</p>
<p>As for <i>Pell&eacute;as and M&eacute;lisande</i>, we believe it to be the perfect
example in opera of music wedded to words and situations, an
opera more remarkable in this respect than even <i>Tristan and
Isolde</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c47"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;PR&Eacute;LUDE &Agrave; L&rsquo;APR&Egrave;S-MIDI D&rsquo;UN FAUNE&rdquo; (ECLOGUE DE ST&Eacute;PHANE MALLARM&Eacute;)</span></h2>
<p>Debussy&rsquo;s <i>Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun</i> is a masterpiece
of imaginative poetry in tones; it is a thing of flawless beauty. It
matters not whether the symbolism of Mallarm&eacute; be cryptic or intelligible.
It matters not whether the explanation of Gosse or of
another be ingenious and plausible. The title is enough to give
a clue to the hearer, if a clue be needed. Debussy himself has
composed nothing more charming in strictly orchestral music.</p>
<p>There is the suggestion of sunlight and warmth, forest and
meadow dear to fauns and nymphs. There is the gentle melancholy
that is associated with a perfect afternoon. There is the exquisite
melodic line, and there is harmonic suggestion with inimitable
coloring that is still more exquisite.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Pr&eacute;lude &agrave; l&rsquo;apr&egrave;s-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i>, completed in 1892, was played for
the first time at a concert of the National Society of Music, Paris,
December 23, 1894. The conductor was Gustave Doret. According to
Charles Koechlin, there had been insufficient rehearsal, so the performance
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
left much to be desired, and the acoustics of the Salle d&rsquo;Harcourt
were unfavorable. When the second performance took place at a
Colonne concert, a critic wrote: &ldquo;This composer seems to dread banality.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; says Koechlin, &ldquo;the charm of this music is so simple,
so melodic. But every <i>new</i> melody should be heard several times.
Besides, even the construction&mdash;a supple melodic line that is expanded&mdash;could
be disconcerting. For certain writers about music, Debussy was
a dangerous artist with a diabolical fascination: the worst possible example.
Diabolical or not, the work has lasted. It has the votes of the
&eacute;lite: that is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second performance was at a Colonne concert, Paris, October 20,
1895. In the <i>Annales du th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>, we find this singular note: &ldquo;Written
after a poem by St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; so sadistic that M. Colonne did not
dare to print the text; young girls attend his concerts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Debussy is attributed a short &ldquo;explanation of his <i>Prelude</i>, a very
free illustration of Mallarm&eacute;&rsquo;s poem&rdquo;: The music evokes &ldquo;the successive
scenes in which the longings and the desire of the Faun pass in the heat
of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; formulated his revolutionary ideas concerning
style about 1875, when the <i>Parnasse contemporain</i> rejected his first poem
of true importance, <i>L&rsquo;Apr&egrave;s-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i>. The poem was published
in 1876 as a quarto pamphlet, illustrated by Manet.</p>
<p>Gosse gave this explanation of the poem that suggested music to
Debussy: &ldquo;It appears in the <i>floril&egrave;ge</i> which he has just published, and I
have now read it again, as I have often read it before. To say that I
understand it bit by bit, phrase by phrase, would be excessive. But, if
I am asked whether this famous miracle of unintelligibility gives me
pleasure, I answer, cordially, Yes. I even fancy that I obtain from it
as definite and as solid an impression as M. Mallarm&eacute; desires to produce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I read in it: A faun&mdash;a simple, sensuous, passionate
being&mdash;wakens in the forest at daybreak and tries to recall his experience
of the previous afternoon. Was he the fortunate recipient of an actual
visit from nymphs, white and golden goddesses, divinely tender and
indulgent? Or is the memory he seems to retain nothing but the shadow
of a vision, no more substantial than the &lsquo;arid rain&rsquo; of notes from his
own flute? He cannot tell. Yet surely there was, surely there is, an
animal whiteness among the brown reeds of the lake that shines out
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
yonder. Were they, are they, swans? No! But Naiads plunging? Perhaps!
Vaguer and vaguer grows that impression of this delicious experience.
He would resign his woodland godship to retain it. A garden
of lilies, golden-headed, white-stalked, behind the trellis of red roses?
Ah! the effort is too great for his poor brain. Perhaps if he selects one
lily from the garth of lilies, one benign and beneficent yielder of
her cup to thirsty lips, the memory, the ever receding memory, may be
forced back. So when he has glutted upon a bunch of grapes, he is wont
to toss the empty skins in the air and blow them out in a visionary
greediness. But no, the delicious hour grows vaguer; experience or
dream, he will never know which it was. The sun is warm, the grasses
yielding; and he curls himself up again, after worshiping the efficacious
star of wine, that he may pursue the dubious ecstasy into the more hopeful
boskages of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, then, is what I read in the so excessively obscure and unintelligible.
<i>L&rsquo;Apr&egrave;s-midi d&rsquo;un faune</i>; and, accompanied as it is with a
perfect suavity of language and melody of rhythm, I know not what
more a poem of eight pages could be expected to give. It supplies a
simple and direct impression of physical beauty, of harmony, of color;
it is exceedingly mellifluous, when once the ear understands that the
poet, instead of being the slave of the Alexandrine, weaves his variations
round it, like a musical composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Afternoon of a Faun</i> is scored for three flutes, two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two harps, small
antique cymbals, strings. It is dedicated to Raymond Bonheur.</p>
<p>The chief theme is announced by the flute, <i>tr&egrave;s mod&eacute;r&eacute;</i>, E major, 9-8.
Louis Laloy gives the reins to his fancy: &ldquo;One is immediately transported
into a better world; all that is leering and savage in the snub-nosed
face of the faun disappears; desire still speaks, but there is a
veil of tenderness and melancholy. The chord of the wood-wind, the
distant call of the horns, the limpid flood of harp tones, accentuate this
impression. The call is louder, more urgent, but it almost immediately
dies away, to let the flute sing again its song. And now the theme
is developed: the oboe enters in, the clarinet has its say; a lively dialogue
follows, and a clarinet phrase leads to a new theme which speaks
of desire satisfied; or it expresses the rapture of mutual emotion rather
than the ferocity of victory. The first theme returns, more languorous,
and the croaking of muted horns darkens the horizon. The theme
comes and goes, fresh chords unfold themselves; at last a solo violoncello
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
joins itself to the flute; and then everything vanishes, as a mist
that rises in the air and scatters itself in flakes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></p>

<dl class="undent i"><dd>a. Nuages</dd>

<p>Baudelaire&rsquo;s prose poem, &ldquo;The Stranger,&rdquo; might serve as motto
for the first nocturne, and for a hint to performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Enigmatical man, whom do you love best? Tell me&mdash;your
mother, your sister, or your brother?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I have neither father, mother, sister, nor brother.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your friends?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You now use a word which to this day has been meaningless
to me.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Your country?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I do not know under what latitude it lies.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Beauty?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I would love her gladly; goddess and immortal.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Well, what do you love, extraordinary stranger?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I love the clouds, the clouds that pass, yonder, the marvellous
clouds.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"><i>Festivals</i>, with its strange processional march, its whirring capriciousness,
makes a more direct appeal. Does the third movement
answer the old question put by Tiberius to the grammarians and
repeated by Sir Thomas Browne, &ldquo;What song did the sirens sing?&rdquo;
Here is music of waves and of sea-women: music that never was
heard on a casino-lined coast, but sounds that might go with &ldquo;The
light that never was, on sea or land.&rdquo; Here is music that is subtly
poetic, music of ineffable beauty. Suppose that Debussy had put
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
words to this song; how he would have cheapened the nocturne!
To each hearer on the ship of Ulysses, or to each hearer of
Debussy&rsquo;s music, the sirens sang of what might well lure him.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The first two nocturnes, <i>Nuages</i> and <i>F&ecirc;tes</i>, were produced at a Lamoureux
concert, Camille Chevillard conductor, Paris, December 9,
1900, and they were played by the same orchestra January 6, 1901. The
third, <i>Sir&egrave;nes</i>, was first produced&mdash;in company with the other two&mdash;at a
Lamoureux concert, October 27, 1901. The third is for orchestra with
chorus of female voices. At this last concert the friends of Debussy
were so exuberant in manifestations of delight that there was sharp
hissing as a corrective. The <i>Nocturnes</i> were composed in 1898, and
published in 1899.</p>
<p>Debussy furnished a programme for the suite; at least, this programme
is attributed to him. Some who are not wholly in sympathy with what
they loosely call &ldquo;the modern movement&rdquo; may think that the programme
itself needs elucidation. Debussy&rsquo;s peculiar forms of expression
in prose are not easily Englished, and it is well-nigh impossible to
reproduce certain shades of meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title <i>Nocturnes</i> is intended to have here a more general and,
above all, a more decorative meaning. We, then, are not concerned
with the form of the Nocturne, but with everything that this word
includes in the way of diversified impression and special lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Clouds</i>: the unchangeable appearance of the sky, with the slow
and solemn march of clouds dissolving in a gray agony tinted with
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Festivals</i>: movement, rhythm dancing in the atmosphere, with
bursts of brusque light. There is also the episode of a procession (a
dazzling and wholly idealistic vision) passing through the festival and
blended with it; but the main idea and substance obstinately remain&mdash;always
the festival and its blended music&mdash;luminous dust participating
in the universal rhythm of all things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sirens</i>: the sea and its innumerable rhythm; then amid the billows
silvered by the moon the mysterious song of the Sirens is heard; it
laughs and passes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alfred Bruneau with regard to the <i>Nocturnes</i>: &ldquo;Here, with the aid
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
of a magic orchestra, he has lent to clouds traversing the sombre sky the
various forms created by his imagination; he has set to running and
dancing the chimerical beings perceived by him in the silvery dust
scintillating in the moonbeams; he has changed the white foam of the
restless sea into tuneful sirens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questioning the precise nature of the form that shapes these <i>Nocturnes</i>,
the reader may well ponder the saying of Plotinus in his &ldquo;Essay
on the Beautiful&rdquo;: &ldquo;But the simple beauty of color arises, when light,
which is something incorporeal, and reason and form, entering the
obscure involutions of matter, irradiates and forms its dark and formless
nature. It is on this account that fire surpasses other bodies in
beauty, because, compared with the other elements, it obtains the order
of form: for it is more eminent than the rest, and is the most subtle
of all, bordering as it were on an incorporeal nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Nocturnes</i> are scored as follows:</p>
<p>I. Two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, three bassoons,
four horns, kettledrums, harp, strings. The movement begins <i>mod&eacute;r&eacute;</i>,
6-4.</p>
<p>II. Three flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, three bassoons,
four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, two
harps, kettledrums, cymbals, and snare drum, strings. <i>Anim&eacute; et tr&egrave;s
rhythm&eacute;</i>, 4-4.</p>
<p>III. Three flutes, oboe, English horn, two clarinets, three bassoons,
four horns, three trumpets, two harps, eight soprano voices, eight
mezzo-soprano voices, strings, <i>mod&eacute;r&eacute;ment anim&eacute;</i>, 12-8.</p>
<p>Debussy before his death made many changes in the instrumentation
of these <i>Nocturnes</i>.</p>

<p>As these sketches are frankly impressionistic, the enjoyment of
the hearer depends largely on his own susceptibility and imagination.
There are persons who do not like the ocean. Oscar Wilde
was disappointed in the Atlantic; but there are more normal
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
beings, far from being poseurs, who cannot exclaim with Jules
Laforgue, &ldquo;the sea, always new, always respectable!&rdquo; We know a
man who was doomed to spend a vacation in a summer hotel on
a bluff looking down on Nantucket Sound. Whenever he sat on
a bench he turned his back to the ocean and faced pine trees,
giving as an excuse that &ldquo;the sea got on his nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debussy&rsquo;s <i>Sea</i> is not for them, neither is it for those who find
pleasure in Mendelssohn&rsquo;s overture, <i>Sea Calm and Prosperous
Voyage</i>, for Debussy knows a wilder ocean, many-faced, now
exulting in &AElig;schylean laughter, now spasmodic, sinister, terrible,
and never so terrible as when calm, or inviting mortals to sport
with it, and smiling&mdash;as though it were forgetful of rotting ships
and sunken treasure and the drowned far down that were for a
time regarded curiously by monsters of the deep.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>These orchestral pieces (I. <i>From Dawn till Noon on the Ocean</i>; II.
<i>Play of the Waves</i>; III. <i>Dialogue of Wind and Sea</i>) were performed for
the first time at a Lamoureux concert in Paris, October 15, 1905. Camille
Chevillard conducted.</p>
<p>Debussy wrote in August, 1903, from Bichain to his publisher Jacques
Durand<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> that he was at work on <i>La Mer</i>. &ldquo;If God will be good to me
the work will be in a very advanced state on my return [to Paris].&rdquo;
He wrote later that the sketches would have three titles: <i>Mer belle aux
&Icirc;les Sanguinaires</i>; <i>Jeux de vagues</i>; <i>Le Vent fait danser la mer</i>; and in
September he said the work was intended for Chevillard. In September,
1904, he wrote from Dieppe, &ldquo;I wanted to finish <i>La Mer</i> here, but I
must still work on the orchestration, which is as tumultuous and varied
as the sea (with all my excuses to the latter).&rdquo; In January, 1905, he was
not sure that the title, &ldquo;<i>De l&rsquo;Aube &agrave; midi sur la mer</i>&rdquo; would do: &ldquo;So
many contradictory things are dancing in my head, and this last attack
of grippe has added its particular dance.&rdquo; He also wrote that he had
remade the end of <i>Jeux de vagues</i>. He was disturbed because Chevillard
spoke of the difficulties in the music, but if he gave the score to Colonne
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
there might be a row. In July and September, 1905, he complained of
&ldquo;very curious corrections&rdquo; made by someone in the proofs; and the
idea of a performance at Chevillard&rsquo;s first concert seemed to him as bad
as a performance at the last one of the season. At rehearsal it was
found that the proofs had been badly read.</p>
<p>The Sketches, dedicated to Jacques Durand, were published at
Paris in 1905. Debussy made an arrangement for two pianos; Andr&eacute;
Caplet made one in 1908 for three pianos.</p>
<p><i>La Mer</i> is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn,
two clarinets, three bassoons and contra-bassoon, four horns, three
trumpets, two <i>cornets-&agrave;-pistons</i>, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums,
bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, glockenspiel, two harps, and
strings.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Debussy and the Sea</span></h3>
<p>Debussy loved and respected the ocean. In 1905 he wrote from
Eastbourne: &ldquo;The sea rolls with a wholly British correctness. There is a
lawn combed and brushed on which little bits of important and
imperialistic English frolic. But what a place to work! No noise, no
pianos, except the delicious mechanical pianos, no musicians talking
about painting, no painters discussing music. In short, a pretty place
to cultivate egoism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Le Puy near Dieppe, August, 1906: &ldquo;Here I am again with my
old friend the sea, always innumerable and beautiful. It is truly the
one thing in nature that puts you in your place; only one does not
sufficiently respect the sea. To wet in it bodies deformed by the daily
life should not be allowed; truly these arms and legs which move in
ridiculous rhythms&mdash;it is enough to make the fish weep. There should
be only Sirens in the sea, and could you wish that these estimable
persons would be willing to return to waters so badly frequented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houlgate, 1911: &ldquo;Here life and the sea continue&mdash;the first to contradict
our native savagery, the second to accomplish its sonorous going
and coming, which cradles the melancholy of those who are deceived
by the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pourville, August, 1915: &ldquo;Trees are good friends, better than the
ocean, which is in motion, wishing to trespass on the land, bite the
rocks, with the anger of a little girl&mdash;singular for a person of its importance.
One would understand it if it sent the vessels about their
business as disturbing vermin.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c50"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;IB&Eacute;RIA&rdquo;: &ldquo;IMAGES&rdquo; FOR ORCHESTRA, NO. 2</span></h2>

<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Les Parfums de la nuit (The Fragrance of the Night)</dd>

<p>The <i>Images</i>, of which <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> is the second movement, are remarkable
in many ways and to be ranked among the first compositions
of this genius. They are impressionistic, but there is a sense
of form; there is also the finest proportion. This music is conspicuous
for exquisite effects of color. There are combinations of
timbres and also contrasts that were hitherto unknown. There are
hints of Spanish melodies; melodies not too openly exposed; there
are intoxicating rhythms, sharply defined, or elusive, and then
they are the more madding.</p>
<p>This music is pleasingly remote from photographic realism. The
title might be &ldquo;Impressions of Spain.&rdquo; There is the suggestion of
street life and wild strains heard on bleak plains or savage mountains;
of the music of the people; of summer nights, warm and
odorous; of the awakening of life with the break of day; of endless
jotas, tangos, seguidillas, fandangoes; of gypsies with their
spells brought from the East; of women with Moorish blood.
<i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> defies analysis and beggars description.</p>
<p>What phrase-mongering, however ingenious, would impart the
beauty of <i>Odors of the Night</i> to him that did not hear the music?
The music that haunts should not be lightly or openly talked
about. The impression made by it should be guarded or confided
only to the closest friend.</p>
<p>To speak of Debussy&rsquo;s use of instruments to gain effects, of his
ability to reproduce what had not been heard by others, though
they may have felt it feebly and had the wish to hear it clearly
and put it in notation, would be a classroom task. To write of it
for the general reader would be only to rhapsodize. Now Debussy
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
is a rhapsodist of the rarest nature, and his musical speech is not
to be translated by a rhapsody in words.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> is the second in a series of three orchestral compositions by
Debussy entitled <i>Images</i>.</p>
<p>The first, <i>Gigues</i>&mdash;it was originally entitled <i>Gigue Triste</i>&mdash;was published
in 1913 and performed for the first time at a Colonne concert,
Paris, January 26, 1913. <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> was performed for the first time at a
Colonne concert in Paris on February 20, 1910, Gabriel Piern&eacute;, conductor.</p>
<p>M. Boutarel wrote after the first performance that the hearers are
supposed to be in Spain. The bells of horses and mules are heard, and
the joyous sounds of wayfarers. The night falls; nature sleeps and is
at rest until bells and <i>aubades</i> announce the dawn, and the world awakens
to life. &ldquo;Debussy appears in this work to have exaggerated his
tendency to treat music with means of expression analogous to those
of the impressionistic painters. Nevertheless, the rhythm remains well
defined and frank in <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i>. Do not look for any melodic design, nor
any carefully woven harmonic web. The composer of <i>Images</i> attaches
importance only to tonal color. He puts his timbres side by side, adopting
a process like that of the <i>Tachistes</i> or the &lsquo;stipplers&rsquo; in distributing
coloring.&rdquo; The Debussyites and &ldquo;<i>Pell&eacute;astres</i>&rdquo; wished <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> repeated,
but, while the majority of the audience was willing to applaud, it did
not long for a repetition. Repeated the next Sunday, <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> aroused
&ldquo;frenetic applause and vehement protestations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> is scored for these instruments: piccolo, three flutes (one interchangeable
with a second piccolo), two oboes, English horn, three clarinets,
three bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three
trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, side drum, tambourine, castanets,
xylophone, celesta, cymbals, three bells (F, G, A), two harps, and the
usual strings.</p>
<p class="tb">Debussy wrote on May 16, 1905, to Jacques Durand, his publisher,
that he was preparing these compositions for two pianofortes: &ldquo;I.
<i>Gigues tristes.</i> II. <i>Ib&eacute;ria.</i> III. <i>Valse</i> (?).&rdquo; In September of that year he
hoped to finish them. 1906, August 8: &ldquo;I have at present three different
ways of finishing <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i>. Shall I toss up a coin or search for a fourth?&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
In September, 1907, the <i>Images</i> would be ready as soon as the <i>Rondes</i>
were &ldquo;<i>comme je le veux et comme il faut</i>.&rdquo; In 1908 Debussy was hard
at work on his opera, <i>The Fall of the House of Usher</i>, an opera of
which, it is said, no sketches have been found. (Durand received Debussy&rsquo;s
libretto in 1917.) In 1909 he wrote that he had laid the <i>Images</i>
aside &ldquo;to the advantage of Edgar Allan Poe.&rdquo; He also worked on an
opera, <i>The Devil in the Belfry</i>.</p>
<p>In 1910: &ldquo;I have seen Piern&eacute;. I think he exaggerates the difficulties
in a performance of <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Debussy wrote on December 4, 1910, from Budapest, where he gave
a concert of his works, that <i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> was especially successful. &ldquo;They could
not play <i>The Sea</i> no more the <i>Nocturnes</i>, from want of rehearsal. I was
assured that the orchestra knew <i>The Sea</i>, for it had been played through
three times. Ah! my friend, if you had heard it!... I assure you to put
<i>Ib&eacute;ria</i> right in two rehearsals was, indeed, an effort.... Don&rsquo;t forget
that these players understood me only through an interpreter&mdash;a sort
of Doctor of Law&mdash;who perhaps transmitted my thought only by deforming
it. I tried every means. I sang, made the gestures of Italian
pantomime, etc.&mdash;it was enough to touch the heart of a buffalo. Well,
they at last understood me, and I had the last word. I was recalled
like a ballet girl, and if the idolatrous crowd did not unharness the
horses of my carriage, it was because I had a simple taxi. The moral
of this journey is that I am not made to exercise the profession of
composer of music in a foreign land. The heroism of a commercial
traveler is needed. One must consent to a sort of compromise which
decidedly repels me.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">DVO&#344;&Aacute;K</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at M&uuml;hlhausen [Nelahozeves] near Kralup, Bohemia, September 8, 1841; died at Prague, May 1, 1904)</p>
<p>The winning and endearing qualities of childhood were in
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s best music: artless simplicity, irresistible frankness, delight
in nature and life. His music was best when it smacked of
the soil, when he remembered his early days, the strains of vagabond
musicians, the dances dear to his folk. One of a happily
primitive people, he delighted in rhythm and color. He was not
the man to translate pictures, statues, poems, a system of metaphysics,
a gospel of pessimism into music. He was least successful
when he would be heroic, mystical, profound. It was an evil day
for him when England &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; him, patronized him, ordered
oratorios from him for her festivals, made him a doctor of music
(as though he were a cathedral organist), and tried to turn this
<i>Naturmensch</i> into a drawing-room and church celebrity. When
Dvo&#345;&aacute;k is dull, he is very dull. His Slavonic Dances and such a
song as &ldquo;Als die alte Mutter&rdquo; are worth a wilderness of &ldquo;St.
Ludmilas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Heldenlieds.&rdquo; And his work as a creative musician
was no doubt at an end when he left this country to go back to
his beloved Prague.</p>
<p>Some have been inclined to think lightly of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k because his
best and vital qualities were recognized by the people. This popularity
irritated those who believe that pure art is only for the
few&mdash;the purists; they forget Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin,
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Verdi, Wagner, Tchaikovsky. But this popularity was based on
the quick recognition of essential qualities: melody, rhythm, color.
Slavonic intensity has a purpose, an esoteric meaning. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k
might have replied to lecturers, essayists, and the genteel in Whitman&rsquo;s
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Do you guess I have some intricate purpose? Well,
I have&mdash;for the Fourth-month showers have, and the
mica on the side of a rock has.</i></p>
<p><i>Do you take it I would astonish? Does the daylight
astonish? Does the early redstail, twittering through
the woods?</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k had his faults, and they were tiresome and exasperating.
His na&iuml;vet&eacute; became a mannerism. Like a child, he delighted in
vain repetitions; he was at times too much pleased with rhythms
and colors, so that he mistook the exterior dress for the substance
and forgot that after all there was little or no substance behind
the brilliant trappings. We believe that he will ultimately be ranked
among the minor poets of music. His complete works may gather
dust in libraries; but no carefully chosen anthology will be without
examples of his piquancy, strength, and beauty in thought and
expression.</p>

<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was an Austrian of a sort, and lived his time in Vienna,
like the others. But he had Czech blood in his veins, and had,
moreover, pretty well formed his style before coming to Vienna;
besides, he was a peasant and had not only been brought up in,
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
but had a native affinity for, the peasant musical atmosphere;
Vienna taught him no dancing-master tricks. It is at once curious
and delightful to note how, in this symphony, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k sticks to his
peasant dialect. Once, in the <i>scherzo</i>, he rises to the Schubert pitch
of civilization (and Schubert himself was an incorrigible man of
the people), but for the rest remains peasant as he was born and
bred. And as his dialect is really his native lingo, it has all the
charm of reality and does not offend nor bore you&mdash;as so-called
dialect novels do. Here in this symphony Dvo&#345;&aacute;k has done, perhaps,
the best work of his life; not the most genuine, for he is
hardly ever anything but genuine, but the most thoroughly poetic
and beautiful. There are parts of the <i>finale</i> that seem clearly intended
as a picture of&mdash;or say, rather, clearly inspired by memories
of&mdash;a peasant&rsquo;s Sunday afternoon <i>Keilerei</i>, or free fight (of the
&ldquo;where you see a head, hit&rdquo; sort).</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Dvo&#345;&aacute;k in 1892-93 was living in New York as the director of the
National Conservatory of Music. He made many sketches for this symphony.
In the first of the three books used for this purpose, he noted
&ldquo;Morning, December 19, 1892.&rdquo; Fuller sketches began January 10,
1893. The slow movement was then entitled &ldquo;<i>Legenda</i>.&rdquo; The <i>scherzo</i>
was completed January 31; the <i>finale</i>, May 25, 1893. A large part of
the instrumentation was done at Spillville, Ia., where many Bohemians
dwelt.</p>
<p>This symphony was performed for the first time, in manuscript, by
the Philharmonic Society of New York on Friday afternoon, December
15, 1893. Anton Seidl conducted. Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was present.</p>
<p>When this symphony was played at Berlin in 1900, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k wrote to
Oskar Nedbal, who conducted it: &ldquo;I send you Kretzschmar&rsquo;s analysis
of the symphony, but omit that nonsense about my having made use
of &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; and &lsquo;American&rsquo; themes&mdash;that is a lie. I tried to write only
in the spirit of those national American melodies. Take the introduction
to the symphony as slowly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony aroused a controversy in which there was shedding
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
of much ink. The controversy long ago died out, and is probably forgotten
even by those who read the polemical articles at the time and
expressed their own opinions. The symphony remains. It is now without
associations that might prejudice. It is now enjoyed or appreciated,
or possibly passed by, as music, and not as an exhibit in a case on trial.</p>
<p>Yet it may be good to recall the circumstances of the symphony&rsquo;s
origin. In the feverish days of the discussion excited by the first performance
of this symphony, it was stated that Mr. Krehbiel and
others called the attention of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, who was then living in New
York, to Negro melodies and rhythms; that the Bohemian composer
then wept with joy and rushed after music paper; that he journeyed
to a Western town inhabited chiefly by Bohemians, a town in Iowa,
where he could find the stimulating atmosphere to write masterpieces
of a truly American nature. Some may also remember that soon after
the first performances of the symphony there was a distressing rumor
that portions of it had been composed long before Dvo&#345;&aacute;k came to
New York; long before his eyes were dimmed and his knees turned
to water by hearing Negro tunes.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the whole matter, according to several Czechs
whom William Ritter (author of a life of Smetana) consulted, is as
follows:</p>
<p>I. The <i>New World</i> symphony expresses the state of soul of an uncultured
Czech in America, the state of a homesick soul remembering
his native land and stupefied by the din and hustle of a new life.</p>
<p>II. The uncultured Czech is a born musician, a master of his trade.
He is interested in the only traces of music that he finds in America.
Negro airs, not copied, adapted, imitated, tint slightly two or three
passages of the symphony without injury to its Czech character.</p>
<p>III. The symphony leaped, Minerva-like, from the head of this uncultured
genius. As nearly all his other compositions, except the operas,
it was not stimulated by any foreign assistance, by any consultation
of authors, or by quotations, reading, etc., as was especially the case
with Brahms.</p>
<p>IV. The national Czech feeling in this work, quickened by homesickness,
is so marked that it is recognized throughout Bohemia, by
the learned and by the humblest.</p>
<p>These are the conclusions of Mr. Ritter after a painstaking investigation.
That Dvo&#345;&aacute;k was most unhappy and pathetically homesick during
his sojourn in New York is known to many, though Mr. Ritter does
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
not enter into any long discussion of the composer&rsquo;s mental condition
in this country.</p>
<p>Yet some will undoubtedly continue to insist that the symphony
<i>From the New World</i> is based, for the most part, on Negro themes,
and that the future of American music rests on the use of Congo, North
American Indian, Creole, Greaser, and Cowboy ditties, whinings,
yawps, and whoopings.</p>
<p>The symphony is scored for two flutes and piccolo, two oboes (one
interchangeable with English horn), two clarinets, two bassoons, four
horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, cymbals,
triangle, and strings.</p>

<p>Nearly one hundred years ago, William Hazlitt wrote a few

<p>Elgar&rsquo;s Variations were once regarded as a brilliant show-piece
for an orchestra. There was a time when Elgar was held to be a
&ldquo;great&rdquo; composer. Time, the Old Man with a Scythe, has a disconcerting
way of handling it. The music with a few exceptions seems
at the best respectable in a middle-class manner; the sort of music
that gives the composer the degree of Mus. Doc. from an English
university. In Elgar&rsquo;s case, his music won him knighthood, and to
this day there are &ldquo;Elgar Festivals&rdquo; in England. Was Cecil Gray
too severe when he wrote of Elgar: &ldquo;He never gets entirely away
from the atmosphere of pale, cultured idealism and the unconsciously
hypocritical, self-righteous, Pharisaical gentlemanliness
which is so characteristic of British art in the last century&rdquo;?</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>These Variations, composed at Malvern in 1899, were first performed
at one of Hans Richter&rsquo;s concerts in London, June 19, 1899. Mr. Felix
Borowski, the excellent editor of the Chicago Orchestra&rsquo;s Programme
Books, says: &ldquo;Richter had never met the English composer when, in
Vienna, he received the score of the Variations from his agent in the
British capital; but the conductor determined to exploit a work which
appeared to him to possess qualities of strength and skill that had not
been made evident in many English compositions. &lsquo;The <i>Enigma</i> Variations,&rsquo;
wrote Robert J. Buckley, &lsquo;toured by Richter&rsquo;s band, set the seal
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
on Elgar&rsquo;s reputation. Richter did for Elgar what he had done for
Wagner thirty years before. England was won for Wagner by Richter
and the <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> overture. England was won for Elgar by Richter
and the <i>Enigma</i> Variations.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> It should, however, be pointed out that
the Variations, as produced by Richter in June, 1899, were not quite
the same composition as that which has been made familiar to every
concert-going audience in the world. After the first performance, Elgar,
at the instigation of Hans Richter, added a <i>coda</i>, and he made various
changes in the orchestration throughout the piece. In this revised form
it was produced at the Worcester Festival, the composer conducting
his work, September 13, 1899.&rdquo; The Variations were first played in
Germany at a concert of the St&auml;dtische Musikverein, D&uuml;sseldorf,
February 7, 1901; Julius Buths, conductor.</p>
<p>The score, which includes a theme and fourteen variations, is dedicated
by the composer to his &ldquo;friends pictured within.&rdquo; Elgar himself
said: &ldquo;It is true that I have sketched, for their amusement and mine,
the idiosyncrasies of fourteen of my friends, not necessarily musicians;
but this is a personal matter and need not have been mentioned publicly.
The Variations should stand simply as a &lsquo;piece&rsquo; of music. The Enigma
I will not explain&mdash;its &lsquo;dark saying&rsquo; must be left unguessed, and I warn
you that the apparent connection between the Variations and the theme
is often of the slightest texture; further, through and over the whole
set another and larger theme &lsquo;goes&rsquo; but is not played.... So the
principal theme never appears, even as in some late dramas&mdash;e.g.,
Maeterlinck&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Intruse</i> and <i>Les Sept Princesses</i>: the chief character is
never on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elgar&rsquo;s work is scored for two flutes and piccolo, two oboes, two
clarinets, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets,
three trombones, bass tuba, snare drum, bass drum, triangle, cymbals,
organ (<i>ad lib.</i>), and strings.</p>
<h3>THEME</h3>
<p>The theme, or the &ldquo;Enigma,&rdquo; is an <i>andante</i>, G minor, 4-4, of a
melancholy nature, with a halting and sighing melody. A few measures
of musical notation would show more clearly the nature of the following
variations than any verbal description, however graphic.</p>
<p>Elgar wrote to the late August Johannes Jaeger that he had composed
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
thirteen variations, but, yielding to superstition, he had called the <i>finale</i>
the fourteenth.</p>
<h3>VARIATIONS</h3>
<p>I. &ldquo;C.A.E.&rdquo; <i>L&rsquo;istesso tempo</i>, G minor, 4-4. The initials are Lady
Elgar&rsquo;s. The theme, changed in rhythm, is given to the second violins
and violas tremolo; flute and clarinet in octaves. The close, <i>pianississimo</i>,
is in G major.</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;H.D.S.-P.&rdquo; <i>Allegro</i>, G minor, 3-8. The theme finally appears in
the violoncellos and basses under a staccato figure for wood-wind, later
violins.</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;R.B.T.&rdquo; <i>Allegretto</i>, G major, 3-8. Fragments of the theme are
played by oboe and violins (<i>pizzicato</i>) against a counter theme for
wood-wind.</p>
<p>IV. &ldquo;W.M.B.&rdquo; A spirited, vigorous variation. <i>Allegro di molto</i>, G
minor-major 3-4. Strings, wood-wind, and horns proclaim the theme.
The last measures call for the full strength of the orchestra.</p>
<p>V. &ldquo;R.P.A.&rdquo; <i>Moderato</i>, C minor, 12-8 (4-4). A counter melody is
developed against the theme (bassoons, violoncellos, and double basses),
first above the theme and then below it.</p>
<p>VI. &ldquo;Ysobel.&rdquo; <i>Andantino</i>, C major 3-2. A lyrical movement with a
cantilena for solo viola, while gentle phrases are given to the woodwind
and horns.</p>
<p>VII. &ldquo;Troyte.&rdquo; <i>Presto</i>, C major, 4-4. Wood-wind and violins have a
bold figure over a <i>basso ostinato</i> for violoncellos, double basses, kettledrums.
This figure, changed, is afterwards given to the basses.</p>
<p>VIII. &ldquo;W.N.&rdquo; <i>Allegretto</i>, G major, 6-8. Clarinets vary the theme.</p>
<p>IX. &ldquo;Nimrod.&rdquo; <i>Moderato</i>, E flat major, 3-4. This and the next variations
are in strong contrast to each other and to those that precede.
&ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; is a tribute to Elgar&rsquo;s friend Jaeger. Elgar&rsquo;s Variations were
performed at a memorial concert to Jaeger in London on January 24,
1910. Hans Richter conducted. Elgar wrote this note for the programme:
&ldquo;The Variations are not all &lsquo;portraits.&rsquo;... Something ardent
and mercurial, in addition to the slow movement (No. IX), would have
been needful to portray the character and temperament of A. J. Jaeger.
The variation is a record of a long summer evening talk, when my
friend grew nobly eloquent (as only he could) on the grandeur of
Beethoven, and especially of his slow movements.&rdquo; The strings (2d
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
violins, violas, and violoncellos divided) sing the theme, <i>pianississimo</i>.
Later the wood-wind and brass enlarge it.</p>
<p>X. &ldquo;Dorabella&mdash;Intermezzo.&rdquo; <i>Allegretto</i>, G major, 3-4, a sparkling,
joyous variation, scored lightly for muted strings and wood-wind; a
horn is heard in one measure, and there are a few strokes on the
kettledrums.</p>
<p>XI. &ldquo;G.R.S.&rdquo; <i>Allegro di molto</i>, G minor, 2-2. An English reviewer
says of this variation: &ldquo;The furious pedaling in the basses seems to
confirm our suspicion that this is the &lsquo;picture&rsquo; of a well-known Cathedral
organist.&rdquo; This organist is probably Dr. George Roberton Sinclair, a
friend and neighbor of Elgar at Hereford. The basses play a staccato
variation of the theme. Later the brass has it <i>fortissimo</i>.</p>
<p>XII. &ldquo;B.G.N.&rdquo; <i>Andante</i>, G minor, 4-4. A song for violoncellos in
which violas join later with first violins for the climax.</p>
<p>XIII. &ldquo;X.X.X.&mdash;Romanza.&rdquo; <i>Moderato</i>, G major, 3-4. The story is
that &ldquo;X.X.X.&rdquo; was at sea when Elgar wrote this variation. We quote
from Mr. Daniel Gregory Mason&rsquo;s essay on Elgar: &ldquo;Violas in a quietly
undulating rhythm suggests the ocean expanse; an almost inaudible
tremor of the drum gives the throb of the engines; a quotation from
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <i>Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage</i> (clarinet) completes
the story. Yet &lsquo;story&rsquo; it is not&mdash;and there is the subtlety of it. Dim sea
and dreamlike steamer are only accessories, after all. The thought of
the distant friend, the human soul there, is what quietly disengages
itself as the essence of the music.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> Ernest Newman speaks of the
&ldquo;curious drum roll, like the faint throb of the engines of a big liner.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>XIV. &ldquo;E.D.U.&mdash;Finale.&rdquo; <i>Allegro</i>, G major, with an introduction.
There are various modifications of tempo; the final section is a <i>presto</i>.
The organ part was added after the first performance. &ldquo;The <i>finale</i> is an
elaborate movement, starting <i>pianissimo</i>, but soon developing strength
and brilliancy in a richly scored marchlike strain, with which anon the
<i>ritmo di tre</i> of Variation IX, &lsquo;Nimrod&rsquo; (but in augmentation) is combined
in a grandiose and triumphant passage, which virtually forms the
climax of the work.&rdquo; There is also a reminiscence of the opening strain
of Variation I, <i>pianississimo</i>.</p>

<p class="center">(Born at Cadiz, November 23, 1876)</p>
<h2 id="c56"><span class="h2line1">BALLET-PANTOMIME: &ldquo;EL AMOR BRUJO&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The suite derived from de Falla&rsquo;s &ldquo;choreographic fantasy,&rdquo; <i>Love,
the Sorcerer</i>, does not suffer so much by its separation from the
theatrical situations, action, and stage settings as other suites arranged
from ballets. There are many pages that are enjoyable as
pure music without thought of a plot and the evolutions of a ballet,
without the question of whether this number or that is illustrative
of an episode in the ballet. If de Falla expresses the wildness of
Spanish gypsy music in a fascinating manner, he is equally fortunate
in the expression of gentle emotions. There is little that is
sensuous or voluptuous in the suite. The music for the scene of the
appearance of a ghost which cools the amorous ardor of Candelas
when her new lover would approach her&mdash;here one is reminded of
the chief theme of Anatole France&rsquo;s amusing and satirical <i>Histoire
comique</i>&mdash;is, perhaps, imbued with passionate fervor for performance
on the stage.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This <i>Gitaneria</i> (Gypsy Life) in one act and two scenes, a choreographic
fantasy with voice and small orchestra, book by Gregorio
Martinez Sierra (known in this country by the plays <i>A Romantic
Young Lady</i>, <i>Cradle Song</i>, <i>The Kingdom of God</i>), was produced at
the Teatro de Lara, Madrid, April 15, 1915, with the Se&ntilde;ora Pastora
Imperio assisting. A concert version was performed at Madrid in 1916,
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
E. Fernandez Arbos conductor, at a concert of the Sociedad Nacional
de M&uacute;sica. According to G. Jean-Aubry, &ldquo;De Falla drew from the
music certain symphonic excerpts, in which he suppressed the spoken
or sung parts and enlarged the instrumentation.... But this did not
alter the essential character of the work, which is to be found in its
particular color, or the semi-Arabian style of its idioms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suite was performed for the first time in London on November
23, 1921.</p>
<p>Sierra based the libretto of de Falla&rsquo;s ballet pantomime on an
Andalusian gypsy story. <i>Brujo</i> means a wizard, a male witch. Mr.
Trent, in his <i>Manuel de Falla and Spanish Music</i>, writes: &ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;Amour
sorcier</i> has misled both audiences and English translators. <i>Love the
Wizard</i> gives an entirely wrong impression; <i>Wedded by Witchcraft</i>,
proposed as an alternative, is a description, more or less, of what
happens; and even that would be better as <i>Wedded in Spite of Witchcraft</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a small orchestra when the work was first produced. As
finally revised, the score calls for piccolo, two flutes, oboe, two
clarinets, bassoon, two horns, two trumpets, kettledrums, bells (A,
D, C), piano, and strings. A mezzo-soprano sings &ldquo;behind&rdquo;; but in
concerts the voice is replaced by a horn, or in one place an English
horn.</p>
<p>When Mr. Arbos conducted this work in St. Louis, the Programme
Book, edited by Harry R. Burke, contained this synopsis of the story
published as a preface to the piano score:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candelas, a young, very beautiful and passionate woman has loved
a wicked, jealous and dissolute, but fascinating and cajoling Gypsy.
Although having led a very unhappy life with him, she has loved him
intensely and mourned his loss, unable ever to forget him. Her memory
of him is something like a hypnotic dream, a morbid, gruesome, and
maddening spell. She is terrified by the thought that the dead may not
be entirely gone, that he may return, that he continues to love her in
that fierce, shadowy, faithless, and caressing way. She lets herself become
a prey to the past as if under the influence of a specter; yet she is
young, strong, vivacious. Spring returns, and with it love, in the shape
of Carmelo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmelo, a handsome youth, enamored and gallant, makes love
to her. Candelas, not unwilling to be won, almost unconsciously returns
his love; but the obsession of her past weighs against her present
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
inclination. When Carmelo approaches her and endeavors to make her
share his passion, the Specter returns and terrifies Candelas, whom he
separates from her lover. They cannot exchange the kiss of perfect
love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmelo being gone, Candelas languishes and droops; she feels as
if bewitched, and her past love seems to flutter heavily about her like
malevolent and foreboding bats. But this evil spell has to be broken,
and Carmelo believes he has found a remedy. He has once been the
comrade of the Gypsy whose specter haunts Candelas. He knows that
the dead lover was the typical faithless and jealous Andalusian gallant.
Since he appears to retain, even after his death, his taste for beautiful
women, he must be taken on his weak side and thus diverted from
his posthumous jealousy in order that Carmelo may exchange with
Candelas the perfect kiss against which the sorcery of love cannot
prevail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carmelo persuades Lucia, a young and enchantingly pretty Gypsy
girl, the friend of Candelas, to simulate acceptance of the Specter&rsquo;s
addresses. Lucia, out of love for Candelas and from feminine curiosity,
agrees. The idea of a flirtation with a ghost seems to her attractive and
novel. And then the dead man was so mirthful in life. Lucia takes
up the sentinel&rsquo;s post. Carmelo returns to make love to Candelas, and
the Specter intervenes ... but he finds the charming little Gypsy, and
neither can nor will resist the temptation, not being experienced in
withstanding the allurements of a pretty face. He makes love to Lucia,
coaxing and imploring her, and the coquettish young Gypsy almost
brings him to despair. In the meantime Carmelo succeeds in convincing
Candelas of his love, and life triumphs over death and the past.
The lovers at last exchange the kiss that defeats the evil influence of
the Specter, who perishes, definitely conquered by love.&rdquo;</p>

<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>The Miller&rsquo;s Dance</dd>

<p>The score calls for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two

<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
tuba, kettledrums, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, xylophone,

<p>When the Russian Ballet visited Spain, Serge de Diaghilev was so
much interested in the work of de Falla that he commissioned him to
write a ballet on the subject of Alarc&oacute;n&rsquo;s novel, <i>El Sombrero de Tres
Picos</i>.</p>
<p>This ballet <i>The Three-cornered Hat</i> was performed for the first
time on any stage by the Russian Ballet at the Alhambra, London.
Joaquin Turina says (<i>The Chesterian</i>, May, 1920) that the first version
of <i>The Three-cornered Hat</i> was produced at the Eslava Theater,
Madrid, under the title of <i>El Corregidor y la Molinera</i>. Turina was
then conducting this theater&rsquo;s orchestra. The &ldquo;pantomime&rdquo; of de Falla
was accompanied by only seventeen players. &ldquo;The composer was confronted
with one great difficulty, and that was to follow musically the
action of the play without spoiling the unity of his score. The music
therefore continually reflected a certain anxiety on the composer&rsquo;s part,
as if he were trying to disentangle himself, so to speak, from the
external network. The transformation of the &lsquo;pantomime&rsquo; into a ballet
at once cleared away all these difficulties. This is quite natural, for in
the new version the action became reduced to a strictly indispensable
minimum, and the dances became predominant, those already existing
being considerably amplified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turina finds the Miller&rsquo;s Dance the most interesting &ldquo;because of its
typically Andalusian character, its fascinating rhythm which is like an
affirmation of Southern art, and its Moorish character.&rdquo; In the Final
Dance the <i>jota</i> and the folk theme called <i>vito</i> are introduced.</p>
<p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (London, July 24, 1919) said of the ballet:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the whole brisk action is the spirit of frivolous comedy of a
kind by no means common only to Spain of the eighteenth century.
A young miller and his wife are the protagonists, and if their existence
be idyllic in theory, it is extraordinarily strenuous in practice&mdash;choreographically.
But that is only another way of saying that M.
Massine and Mme Karsavina, who enact the couple, are hardly ever off
the stage, and that both of them work with an energy and exuberance
that almost leave one breathless at moments. The miller and his wife
between them, however, would scarcely suffice even for a slender
ballet plot. So we have as well an amorous <i>corregidor</i> (or governor),
who orders the miller&rsquo;s arrest so that the way may be cleared for a
pleasant little flirtation&mdash;if nothing more serious&mdash;with the captivating
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
wife. Behold the latter fooling him with a seductive dance, and then
evading her admirer with such agility that, in his pursuit of her, he
tumbles over a bridge into the mill stream. But, as this is comedy, and
not melodrama, the would-be lover experiences nothing worse than a
wetting, and the laugh, which is turned against him, is renewed when,
having taken off some of his clothes to dry them and gone to rest
on the miller&rsquo;s bed, his presence is discovered by the miller himself,

<p class="center">(Born at Li&egrave;ge, Belgium, December 10, 1822; died at Paris, November 8, 1890)</p>
<p>What a characteristic figure is this artist of the nineteenth century,
whose profile stands out so boldly from the surroundings in
which he lived! An artist of another age, whose work makes one
think of that of the great Bach! Franck went through this life as
a dreamer, seeing little or nothing of that which passed about him,
thinking only of his art, and living only for it. True artists are subject
to this kind of hypnotism&mdash;the inveterate workers, who find
the recompense of their labor in the accomplished fact, and an incomparable
joy in the pure and simple toil of each day. They have
no need to search for the echo in the crowd.</p>
<p class="tb">When Ysaye and Lachaume introduced Franck&rsquo;s violin sonata
(in Boston) in 1895; when these and others introduced the magnificent
piano quintet in 1898, leading musicians of this city shook
wise heads and said with an air of finality: &ldquo;This will never do.&rdquo;
The string quartet was only tolerated, endured because it was produced
at a Kneisel concert, and at that time the Kneisels could do
no wrong. <i>The Wild Huntsman</i>, produced here by Theodore
Thomas in 1898, was looked on as the work of an eccentric and
theatrical Frenchman.</p>
<p>When Mr. Gericke produced the symphony in 1899, the storm
broke loose. There were letters of angry protest. A leading critic
characterized the symphony as &ldquo;dismal.&rdquo; Several subscribers to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
concerts called it &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; and vowed they would not attend any
concert at which music by Franck was to be played.</p>
<p>Nor did Franck fare better for a time in New York. Even the
broad-minded James Huneker dismissed him as a sort of Abb&eacute;
Liszt, now in the heavily scented boudoir, now with self-conscious
devotion in the church. Franck in the boudoir! Poor &ldquo;<i>P&egrave;re</i>&rdquo;
Franck!</p>
<p>And so Franck had to make his way here, as in Paris, misunderstood,
abused, regarded by some as an anarchist, by some as a bore.
This, men and brethren, should make us all tolerant, even cautious
in passing judgment on contemporary composers whose idiom is as
yet strange to us. Cocksure opinions are valuable chiefly to the one
who expresses them.</p>
<p>Let us hear what is going on in the musical world, even if it
is going on noisily and queerly in our ears. It is not enough to say:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. Why does &mdash;&mdash; put such pieces on the programme?&rdquo;
Inherently bad music will soon disappear of itself, unless it is so
bad, with such obviously vulgar tunes, that it becomes popular.
But music is not necessarily bad because it is of a strange and irregular
nature. For audiences to have no curiosity about new
works, no spur to hot discussion concerning them, is a sign of stagnation
in art. Thus C&eacute;sar Franck, a great teacher, teaches us all
indirectly a lesson.</p>

<p>As the &ldquo;<i>Pell&eacute;astres</i>&rdquo; for a time did Debussy harm, so the &ldquo;Franckists&rdquo;
injured the reputation of C&eacute;sar Franck. They insisted on his
aloofness from earthly strife, joy, sorrow, passion. They proclaimed
him a mystic, dwelling in the seventh heaven and hearing, if not
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
the celestial choir, at least the music of the spheres. His compositions
were of plenary inspiration: not a note could be added; not a
note could be taken away.</p>
<p>A reaction was inevitable. Younger composers, escaping his influence,
were tired of his alleged perfection. Older composers, envious
no doubt of his fame, were wearied by the recital of his
private and musical virtues. Was he overestimated soon after his
death? For some years it has been the fashion to underestimate
him; to speak of &ldquo;the false mysticism of the old Belgian angel.&rdquo;
Too frequent repetitions of his music, even of that masterpiece
the violin sonata and of his symphony, were not of benefit to him.
(It was as with Tchaikovsky and his <i>Pathetic</i> symphony.)</p>
<p>Today it is only just to recognize Franck&rsquo;s eminence among composers.
To say that his symphony is flawless is not so easy. We
believe that in the first movement the return of the somber introduction,
even with a changed tonality, before the full exposition,
development and continuance of the main body of the movement,
was a mistake. It might reasonably be said that there is in this
movement overelaboration, a surplusage of detail, unnecessary
repetitions of thematic fragments given in turn to various instruments
or choirs of instruments, a favorite device of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s.
There might something be said with regard to diffuseness in the
other movements.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was produced at the Conservatoire, Paris, February 17,
1889. It was composed in 1888 and completed August 22 of that year.</p>
<p>Vincent d&rsquo;Indy<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> in his Life of Franck gives some particulars about
the first performance of the Symphony in D minor. &ldquo;The performance
was quite against the wish of most members of the famous orchestra,
and was only pushed through thanks to the benevolent obstinacy of
the conductor, Jules Garcin. The subscribers could make neither head
nor tail of it, and the musical authorities were much in the same position.
I inquired of one of them&mdash;a professor at the Conservatoire, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
a kind of factotum on the committee&mdash;what he thought of the work.
&lsquo;That a symphony?&rsquo; he replied in contemptuous tones. &lsquo;But, my dear
sir, who ever heard of writing for the English horn in a symphony?
Just mention a single symphony by Haydn or Beethoven introducing
the English horn. There, well, you see&mdash;your Franck&rsquo;s music may be
whatever you please, but it will certainly never be a symphony!&rsquo;&rdquo; This
was the attitude of the Conservatoire in the year of grace 1889.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At another door of the concert hall, the composer of <i>Faust</i>, escorted
by a train of adulators, male and female, fulminated a kind of papal
decree to the effect that this symphony was the affirmation of incompetence
pushed to dogmatic lengths. For sincerity and disinterestedness
we must turn to the composer himself, when, on his return from the
concert, his whole family surrounded him, asking eagerly for news.
&lsquo;Well, were you satisfied with the effect on the public? Was there
plenty of applause?&rsquo; To which &lsquo;Father Franck,&rsquo; thinking only of his
work, replied with a beaming countenance: &lsquo;Oh, it sounded well; just
as I thought it would!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Indy describes Gounod leaving the concert hall of the Conservatoire
after the first performance of Franck&rsquo;s symphony, surrounded by
incense burners of each sex, and saying particularly that this symphony
was &ldquo;the affirmation of impotence pushed to dogma.&rdquo; Perhaps Gounod
made this speech; perhaps he didn&rsquo;t; some of Franck&rsquo;s disciples are too
busy in adding to the legend of his martyrdom. D&rsquo;Indy says little about
the structure of this symphony, although he devotes a chapter to
Franck&rsquo;s string quartet.</p>
<p>Speaking of Franck&rsquo;s sonata for violin and pianoforte, he calls
attention to the fact that the first of its organic germs is used as the
theme of the four movements of the work. &ldquo;From this moment cyclical
form, the basis of modern symphonic art, was created and consecrated.&rdquo;
He then adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majestic, plastic, and perfectly beautiful Symphony in D minor
is constructed on the same method. I purposely use the word <i>method</i>
for this reason: After having long described Franck as an empiricist
and an improviser&mdash;which is radically wrong&mdash;his enemies (of whom,
in spite of his incomparable goodness, he made many) and his ignorant
detractors suddenly changed their views and called him a musical
mathematician, who subordinated inspiration and impulse to a conscientious
manipulation of form. This, we may observe in passing, is a
common reproach brought by the ignorant Philistine against the
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
dreamer and the genius. Yet where can we point to a composer in the
second half of the nineteenth century who could&mdash;and did&mdash;think as
loftily as Franck, or who could have found in his fervent and enthusiastic
heart such vast ideas as those which lie at the musical basis
of the symphony, the quartet, and <i>The Beatitudes</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It frequently happens in the history of art that a breath passing
through the creative spirits of the day incites them, without any
previous mutual understanding, to create works which are identical in
form, if not in significance. It is easy to find examples of this kind of
artistic telepathy between painters and writers, but the most striking
instances are furnished by the musical art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without going back upon the period we are now considering, the
years between 1884 and 1889 are remarkable for a curious return to
pure symphonic form. Apart from the younger composers, and one or
two unimportant representatives of the old school, three composers who
had already made their mark&mdash;Lalo, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and Franck&mdash;produced
true symphonies at this time, but widely different as regards
external aspects and ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lalo&rsquo;s Symphony in G minor, which is on very classical lines, is
remarkable for the fascination of its themes, and still more for charm
and elegance of rhythm and harmony, distinctive qualities of the
imaginative composer of <i>Le Roi d&rsquo;Ys</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The C minor symphony of Saint-Sa&euml;ns, displaying undoubted talent,
seems like a challenge to the traditional laws of tonal structure; and
although the composer sustains the combat with cleverness and eloquence,
and in spite of the indisputable interest of the work&mdash;founded,
like many others by this composer, upon a prose theme, the <i>Dies Ir&aelig;</i>&mdash;yet
the final impression is that of doubt and sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Franck&rsquo;s symphony, on the contrary, is a continual ascent towards
pure gladness and life-giving light because its workmanship is solid,
and its themes are manifestations of ideal beauty. What is there more
joyous, more sanely vital, than the principal subject of the <i>finale</i>,
around which all the other themes in the work cluster and crystallize?
While in the higher registers all is dominated by that motive which
M. Ropartz has justly called &lsquo;the theme of faith.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two
clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, two
cornets, three trombones, bass tuba, tympani, harps, and strings. The
score is dedicated to Henri Duparc.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">HANDEL</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Halle, February 23, 1685; died at London, April 14, 1759)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Georg Frideric Handel,&rdquo; Mr. Runciman once wrote, &ldquo;is
by far the most superb personage one meets, in the history of
music. He alone, of all the musicians, lived his life straight through
in the grand manner.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> When Handel wrote &ldquo;<i>pomposo</i>&rdquo; on a page,
he wrote not idly. What magnificent simplicity in outlines!...
For melodic lines of such chaste and noble beauty, such Olympian
authority, no one has approached Handel. &ldquo;Within that circle none
durst walk but he.&rdquo; His nearest rival is the Chevalier Gluck.</p>
<p>And this giant of a man could express a tenderness known only
to him and Mozart, for Schubert, with all his melodic wealth and
sensitiveness, could fall at times into sentimentalism, and Schumann&rsquo;s
intimate confessions were sometimes whispered. Handel in
his tenderness was always manly. No one has approached him in
his sublimely solemn moments! Few composers, if there is anyone,
have been able to produce such pathetic or sublime effects by
simple means, by a few chords even. He was one of the greatest
melodists. His fugal pages seldom seem labored; they are distinguished
by amazing vitality and spontaneity. In his slow movements,
his instrumental airs, there is a peculiar dignity, a peculiar
serenity, and a direct appeal that we find in no other composer.</p>
<p>Would that we could hear more of Handel&rsquo;s music! At present
he is known in this country as the composer of <i>The Messiah</i>, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
variations entitled <i>The Harmonious Blacksmith</i>, and the monstrous
perversion of a simple operatic air dignified, forsooth, by the title
&ldquo;<i>Handel&rsquo;s Largo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Handel apparently took a peculiar pride in his Concerti Grossi.
He published them himself, and by subscription. They would
probably be more popular today if all conductors realized the fact
that music in Handel&rsquo;s time was performed with varied and free
inflections; that his players undoubtedly employed many means of
expression. As German organists of forty years ago insisted that
Bach&rsquo;s preludes, fugues, toccatas, should be played with full organ
and rigidity of tempo, although those who heard Bach play admired
his skill in registration, many conductors find in all of the
<i>allegros</i> of Handel&rsquo;s concertos only a thunderous speech and allow
little change in tempo. In the performance of this old music, old
but fresh, the two essential qualities demanded by Handel&rsquo;s music,
suppleness of pace and fluidity of expression, named by Volbach,
are usually disregarded. Unless there be elasticity in performance,
hearers are not to be blamed if they find the music formal, monotonous,
dull.</p>
<p>The twelve concertos were composed within three weeks.
Kretzschmar has described them as impressionistic pictures, probably
without strict reference to the modern use of the word &ldquo;impressionistic.&rdquo;
They are not of equal worth. Romain Rolland<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> finds
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
the seventh and three last mediocre. In the tenth he discovers
French influences and declares that the last <i>allegro</i> might be an air
for a music box. Yet the music at its best is aristocratic and noble.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Handel&rsquo;s twelve grand concertos for strings were composed between
September 29 and October 30, 1739. The London <i>Daily Post</i> of October
29, 1739, said: &ldquo;This day are published proposals for printing by
subscription, with His Majesty&rsquo;s royal license and protection, Twelve
Grand Concertos, in Seven Parts, for four violins, a tenor, a violoncello,
with a thorough-bass for the harpsichord. Composed by Mr. Handel.
Price to subscribers, two guineas. Ready to be delivered by April next.
Subscriptions are taken by the author, at his house in Brook Street,
Hanover Square, and by Walsh.&rdquo; In an advertisement on November 22
the publisher added, &ldquo;Two of the above concertos will be performed
this evening at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo; The concertos were
published on April 21, 1740. In an advertisement a few days afterwards
Walsh said, &ldquo;These concertos were performed at the Theatre Royal in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, and now are played in most public places with
the greatest applause.&rdquo; Victor Schoelcher made this comment in his
<i>Life of Handel</i>: &ldquo;This was the case with all the works of Handel. They
were so frequently performed at contemporaneous concerts and benefits
that they seem, during his lifetime, to have quite become public
property. Moreover, he did nothing which the other theaters did not
attempt to imitate. In the little theater of the Haymarket, evening
entertainments were given in exact imitation of his &lsquo;several concertos
for different instruments, with a variety of chosen airs of the best
master, and the famous <i>Salve Regina</i> of Hasse.&rsquo; The handbills issued by
the nobles at the King&rsquo;s Theatre make mention also of &lsquo;several concertos
for different instruments.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
<p class="tb">The year 1739, in which these concertos were composed, was the
year of the first performance of Handel&rsquo;s <i>Saul</i> (January 16) and <i>Israel
in Egypt</i> (April 4)&mdash;both oratorios were composed in 1738&mdash;also of
the music to Dryden&rsquo;s <i>Ode for St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day</i> (November 22).</p>
<p>Romain Rolland, discussing the form <i>concerto grosso</i>, which consists
essentially of a dialogue between a group of soloists, the <i>concertino</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
(trio of two solo violins and solo bass with cembalo) and the chorus
of instruments, <i>concerto grosso</i>, believes that Handel at Rome in 1708
was struck by Corelli&rsquo;s works in this field, for several of his concertos
of Opus 3 are dated 1710, 1716, 1722. Geminiani introduced the concerto
into England&mdash;three volumes appeared in 1732, 1735, 1748&mdash;and
he was a friend of Handel.</p>
<p>It is stated that the word &ldquo;concerto,&rdquo; as applied to a piece for a solo
instrument with accompaniment, first appeared in a treatise by Scipio
Bargaglia (Venice, 1587); that Giuseppe Torelli, who died in 1708,
was the first to suggest a larger number of instruments in a concerto,
and to give the name <i>concerto grosso</i> to this species of composition.
But Michelletti, seventeen years before, had published his <i>Sinfonie e
concerti a quatro</i>, and in 1698 his <i>Concerti musicali</i>, while the word
&ldquo;concerto&rdquo; occurs frequently in the musical terminology of the
seventeenth century. It was Torelli who, determining the form of the
grand solo for violin, opened the way to Archangelo Corelli, the father
of modern violinists, composers, or virtuosos.</p>
<p class="tb">Romain Rolland insisted that the instrumental music of Handel has
the nature of a constant improvisation, music to be served piping hot
to an audience, and should preserve this character in performance.
&ldquo;When you have studied with minute care each detail, obtained from
your orchestra an irreproachable precision, tonal purity, and finish, you
will have done nothing unless you have made the face of the improvising
genius rise from the work.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c62"><span class="h2line1">FRANZ JOSEF</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HAYDN</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Rohrau, Lower Austria, March 31, 1732; died at Vienna, May 31, 1809)</p>
<p>Haydn has been sadly misunderstood by present followers of
tradition who have spoken of him as a man of the old school,
while Mozart was a forerunner of Beethoven. Thus they erred.
Mozart summed up the school of his day and wrote imperishable
music. There has been only one Mozart, and there is no probability
of another being born for generations to come; but Haydn was
often nearer in spirit to the young Beethoven. It is customary to
speak lightly of Haydn as an honest Austrian who wrote light-hearted
<i>allegros</i>, also minuets by which one is not reminded of a
court with noble dames smiling graciously on gallant cavaliers, but
sees peasants thumping the ground with heavy feet and uttering
joyful cries.</p>
<p>It is said carelessly that Haydn was a simple fellow who wrote
at ease many symphonies and quartets that, to quote Berlioz, recall
&ldquo;the innocent joys of the fireside and the <i>pot-au-feu</i>.&rdquo; But Haydn
was shrewd and observing&mdash;read his diary, kept in London&mdash;and
if he was plagued with a shrewish wife he found favor with other
women. Dear Mrs. Schroeter of London received letters from him
breathing love, not manly complimentary affection. And it is said
of Haydn that he was only sportive in his music, having a fondness
for the bassoon. But Haydn could express tenderness, regret, sorrow
in his music.</p>

<p>Haydn&rsquo;s symphony is ever fresh, spontaneous, yet contrapuntally
worked in a masterly manner. What a skillful employment of
little themes in themselves of slight significance save for their
Blakelike innocence and gayety! Yet in the introduction there is a
deeper note, for, contrary to current and easy belief, Haydn&rsquo;s music
is not all beer, skittles, and dancing. There are even gloomy pages
in some of his quartets; tragic pages in his <i>Seven Last Words</i>, and
the prelude to <i>The Creation</i>, depicting chaos, is singularly contemporaneous.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Haydn composed twelve symphonies in England for Salomon. His
name began to be mentioned in England in 1765. Symphonies by him
were played in concerts given by J. C. Bach, Abel, and others in the
&rsquo;seventies. Lord Abingdon tried in 1783 to persuade Haydn to take
the direction of the Professional Concerts which had just been
founded. Gallini asked him his terms for an opera. Salomon, violinist,
conductor, manager, sent a music publisher, one Bland&mdash;an auspicious
name&mdash;to coax him to London, but Haydn was loath to leave Prince
Esterhazy. Prince Nicolaus died in 1790, and his successor, Prince
Anton, who did not care for music, dismissed the orchestra at Esterh&aacute;z
and kept only a brass band; but he added 400 gulden to the annual
pension of 1,000 gulden bequeathed to Haydn by Prince Nicolaus.
Haydn then made Vienna his home. And one day, when he was at
work in his house, the &ldquo;Hamberger&rdquo; house in which Beethoven also
once lived, a man appeared, and said: &ldquo;I am Salomon from London,
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
and come to fetch you with me. We will agree on the job tomorrow.&rdquo;
Haydn was intensely amused by the use of the word &ldquo;job.&rdquo; The contract
for one season was as follows: Haydn should receive three hundred
pounds for an opera written for the manager Gallini, &pound;300 for
six symphonies and &pound;200 for the copyright, &pound;200 for twenty new
compositions to be produced in as many concerts under Haydn&rsquo;s direction,
&pound;200 as guarantee for a benefit concert, Salomon deposited 5,000
gulden with the bankers, Fries &amp; Company, as a pledge of good faith.
Haydn had 500 gulden ready for traveling expenses, and he borrowed
450 more from his prince. Haydn agreed to conduct the symphonies at
the piano.</p>
<p>Salomon about 1786 began to give concerts as a manager, in addition
to fiddling at concerts of others. He had established a series of subscription
concerts at the Hanover Square Rooms, London. He thought
of Haydn as a great drawing card. The violinist W. Cramer, associated
with the Professional Concerts, had also approached Haydn, who
would not leave his prince. The news of Prince Esterhazy&rsquo;s death
reached Salomon, who then happened to be at Bonn. He therefore
hastened to Vienna.</p>
<p>The first of the Salomon-Haydn concerts was given March 11, 1791,
at the Hanover Square Rooms. Haydn, as was the custom, &ldquo;presided at
the harpsichord&rdquo;; Salomon stood as leader of the orchestra. The symphony
was in D major, No. 2, of the London list of twelve. The
<i>adagio</i> was repeated, an unusual occurrence, but the critics preferred
the first movement.</p>
<p>The orchestra was thus composed: twelve to sixteen violins, four
violas, three violoncellos, four double basses, flute, oboe, bassoon, horns,
trumpets, drums&mdash;in all about forty players.</p>
<p>Haydn and Salomon left Vienna on December 15, 1790, and arrived
at Calais by way of Munich and Bonn. They crossed the English
Channel on New Year&rsquo;s Day, 1791. From Dover they traveled to
London by stage. The journey from Vienna took them seventeen days.
Haydn was received with great honor.</p>
<p>Haydn left London towards the end of June, 1792. Salomon invited
him again to write six new symphonies. Haydn arrived in London,
February 4, 1794, and did not leave England until August 15, 1795. The
orchestra at the opera concerts in the grand new concert hall of the
King&rsquo;s Theatre was made up of sixty players. Haydn&rsquo;s engagement was
again a profitable one. He made by concerts, lessons, symphonies, etc.,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
&pound;1,200. He was honored in many ways by the King, the Queen, and
the nobility. He was twenty-six times at Carlton House, where the
Prince of Wales had a concert room; and, after he had waited long
for his pay, he sent a bill from Vienna for 100 guineas, which Parliament
promptly settled.</p>

<p>This symphony, known as the &ldquo;<i>Surprise</i>,&rdquo; and in Germany as the
symphony &ldquo;with the drumstroke,&rdquo; is the third of the twelve Salomon
symphonies as arranged in the order of their appearance in the
catalogue of the Philharmonic Society (London).</p>
<p>Composed in 1791, this symphony was performed for the first time
on March 23, 1792, at the sixth Salomon concert in London. It pleased
immediately and greatly. <i>The Oracle</i> characterized the second movement
as one of Haydn&rsquo;s happiest inventions, and likened the &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;&mdash;which
is occasioned by the sudden orchestral crash in the <i>andante</i>&mdash;to
a shepherdess, lulled by the sound of a distant waterfall, awakened
suddenly from sleep and frightened by the unexpected discharge of a
musket.</p>
<p>Griesinger in his Life of Haydn (1810) contradicts the story that
Haydn introduced these crashes to arouse the Englishwomen from sleep.
Haydn also contradicted it; he said it was his intention only to surprise
the audience by something new. &ldquo;The first <i>allegro</i> of my symphony was
received with countless &lsquo;Bravos,&rsquo; but enthusiasm rose to its highest
pitch after the <i>andante</i> with the drumstroke. &lsquo;<i>Ancora! ancora!</i>&rsquo; was
cried out on all sides, and Pleyel himself complimented me on my
idea.&rdquo; On the other hand, Gyrowetz, in his Autobiography, page 59
(1848), said that he visited Haydn just after he had composed the
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
<i>andante</i>, and Haydn was so pleased with it that he played it to him
on the piano, and sure of his success, said with a roguish laugh: &ldquo;The
women will cry out here!&rdquo; C. F. Pohl<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> added a footnote, when he
quoted this account of Gyrowetz, and called attention to Haydn&rsquo;s
humorous borrowing of a musical thought of Martini to embellish his
setting of music to the commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal,&rdquo; when
he had occasion to put music to the Ten Commandments. The <i>Surprise</i>
symphony was long known in London as &ldquo;the favorite grand overture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Parisian orchestra, which Haydn undoubtedly had in mind,
was a large one&mdash;forty violins, twelve violoncellos, eight double
basses&mdash;so that the composer could be sure of strong contrasts in
performance by the string section. Fortunate composer&mdash;whose
symphonies one can, sitting back, enjoy without inquiring into psychological
intention or noting attempts at realism in musical seascapes
and landscapes&mdash;music not inspired by book or picture&mdash;just
music; now pompous, now merry, and in more serious moments,

<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Haydn wrote a set of six symphonies for a society in Paris known as
the <i>Concert de la loge olympique</i>. They were ordered in 1784, when
Haydn was living at Esterh&aacute;z. Composed in the course of the years
1784-89, they are in C, G minor, E flat, B flat, D, A. No. 1, in C, has
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
been entitled the &ldquo;<i>Bear</i>&rdquo;; No. 2, in G minor, has been entitled the
&ldquo;<i>Hen</i>&rdquo;; and No. 4, in B flat, is known as the &ldquo;<i>Queen of France</i>.&rdquo; This
symphony is the first of a second set, of which five were composed in
1787, 1788, 1790. If the sixth was written, it cannot now be identified.
This one in G major was written in 1787, and is numbered 88 in the
full and chronological listing of Mandyczewski (given in Grove&rsquo;s
Dictionary).</p>
<p>I. The first movement opens with a short, slow introduction, <i>adagio</i>,
G major, 3-4 which consists for the most part of strong <i>staccato</i> chords
which alternate with softer passages. The main body of the movement
<i>allegro</i>, G major, begins with the first theme, a dainty one, announced
<i>piano</i> by the strings without double basses and repeated <i>forte</i> by the
full orchestra with a new counter figure in the bass. A subsidiary theme
is but little more than a melodic variation of the first. So, too, the
short conclusion theme&mdash;in oboes and bassoon, then in the strings&mdash;is
only a variation of the first. The free fantasia is long for the period
and is contrapuntally elaborate. There is a short <i>coda</i> on the first
theme.</p>
<p>II. <i>Largo</i>, D major, 3-4. A serious melody is sung by oboe and
violoncellos to an accompaniment of violas, double basses, bassoon, and
horn. The theme is repeated with a richer accompaniment; while the
first violins have a counter figure. After a transitional passage the theme
is repeated by a fuller orchestra, with the melody in first violins and
flute, then in the oboe and violoncello. The development is carried
along on the same lines. There is a very short <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>III. The <i>Menuetto</i>, <i>allegretto</i>, G major, 3-4, with trio, is in the
regular minuet form in its simplest manner.</p>
<p>IV. The <i>finale</i>, <i>allegro con spirito</i>, G major, 2-4, is a <i>rondo</i> on the
theme of a peasant country dance, and it is fully developed. Haydn in
his earlier symphonies adopted for the <i>finale</i> the form of his first
movement. Later he preferred the <i>rondo</i> form, with its couplets and
refrains, or repetitions of a short and frank chief theme. &ldquo;In some
<i>finales</i> of his last symphonies,&rdquo; says Brenet,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> &ldquo;he gave freer reins to
his fancy, and modified with greater independence the form of his
first <i>allegros</i>; but his fancy, always prudent and moderate, is more like
the clear, precise arguments of a great orator than the headlong inspiration
of a poet. Moderation is one of the characteristics of Haydn&rsquo;s
genius; moderation in the dimensions, in the sonority, in the melodic
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
shape; the liveliness of his melodic thought never seems extravagant,
its melancholy never induces sadness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The usual orchestration of Haydn&rsquo;s symphonies (including those listed above)
consisted of one (or two) flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets,
kettledrums, and strings. In his last years (from 1791) he followed Mozart&rsquo;s
lead in introducing two clarinets. The clarinets accordingly appear in the London
symphony in D major, described in this chapter.&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">HINDEMITH</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Hanau, on November 16, 1895)</p>
<h2 id="c67"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;KONZERTMUSIK&rdquo; FOR STRING AND BRASS INSTRUMENTS</span></h2>
<p>There was a time in Germany when Hindemith was regarded as
the white-haired boy; the hope for the glorious future; greater even
than Sch&ouml;nberg. In England, they look on Hindemith coolly&mdash;an
able and fair-minded critic there has remarked: &ldquo;The more one
hears of the later Hindemith, the more exasperating his work becomes.
From time to time some little theme is shown at first in
sympathetic fashion, then submitted to the most mechanical processes
known to music. Any pleasant jingle seems to mesmerize
the composer, who repeats it much as Bruckner repeats his themes&mdash;Hindemith
abuses the liberty shown to a modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hindemith is not always mesmerized by a pleasant jingle.
Witness his oratorio, performed with great success. The title is forbidding,
<i>The Unending</i>, but the performance takes only two hours.
The <i>Concert Music</i>, composed for the fiftieth anniversary of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, is more than interesting. It cannot be
called &ldquo;noble,&rdquo; not even &ldquo;grand,&rdquo; but it holds the attention by its
strength in structure, its spirit, festal without blatancy. For once
there is no too evident desire to stun the hearer. It is as if the composer
had written for his own pleasure. It is virile music with relieving
passages&mdash;few in number&mdash;that have genuine and simple
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
beauty of thought and expression; exciting at times by the rushing
rhythm.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Hindemith, at the age of eleven, played the viola in the theater and
in the moving-picture house; when he was thirteen, he was a viola
virtuoso, and he now plays in public his own concertos for that instrument.
When he was twenty, he was first concert master of the Frankfort
opera house. His teachers in composition were Arnold Mendelssohn
and Bernhard Sekles at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfort. He is the
viola player in the Amar Quartet (Licco Amar, Walter Casper, Paul
Hindemith, and Maurits Frank&mdash;in 1926 his brother Rudolf was the
violoncellist).</p>
<p class="tb">Apropos of a performance of one of his works, in Berlin, the late
Adolf Weissmann wrote in a letter to the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>:
&ldquo;Promising indeed among the young German composers is Paul
Hindemith. More than promising he is not yet. For the viola player
Paul Hindemith, travelling with the Amar Quartet through half
Europe, has seldom time enough to work carefully. The greater part
of his compositions were created in the railway car. Is it, therefore, to
be wondered at that their principal virtue lies in their rhythm? The
rhythm of the rolling car is, apparently, blended with the rhythm
springing from within. It is always threatening to outrun all the other
values of what he writes. For that these values exist cannot be denied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A foreign correspondent of the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, having
heard one of his compositions, wrote: &ldquo;It was all rather an exhilarating
nightmare, as if Hindemith had been attempting to prove the theorem
of Pythagoras in terms of parallelograms, which is amusing, but utterly
absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said by A. Machabey that Hindemith has been influenced
in turn by Wagner, Brahms&mdash;&ldquo;an influence still felt&rdquo;; Richard Strauss;
Max Reger, who attracted him by his ingenuity and freedom from elementary
technic; Stravinsky, who made himself felt after the war; and
finally by the theatrical surroundings in which he lives. &ldquo;He is opposed
to post-romanticism. Not being able to escape from romanticism in his
youth, today he seems to be completely stripped of it. Freed from the
despotism of a text, from the pre&euml;stablished plan of programme music,
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
from obedience to the caprices and emphasis of sentiment, music in
itself suffices.... The reaction against romanticism is doubled by a
democratic spirit which was general in Germany after the war.&rdquo;
Therefore he has had many supporters, who welcomed, &ldquo;besides this
new spirit, an unexpected technic, unusual polyphony and instrumentation,
in which one found a profound synthesis of primordial rhythms,
tonalities enriched and extended by Sch&ouml;nberg and Hauer, economical
and rational groupings of jazz.&rdquo; Then his compositions are so varied:
chamber music for the ultra-fastidious; melodies for amateurs; dramatic
works for opera-goers; orchestral pieces for frequenters of concerts; he
has written for d&eacute;butantes and children; for the cinema, marionettes,
mechanical pianos, brass bands. Work has followed work with an
amazing rapidity.</p>

<p class="center">(Born at Havre, France, on March 10, 1892)</p>
<h2 id="c69"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;PACIFIC 231,&rdquo; ORCHESTRAL MOVEMENT</span></h2>
<p>Some say that Honegger had no business to summon a locomotive
engine for inspiration. No doubt this music of Honegger&rsquo;s is
&ldquo;clever,&rdquo; but cleverness in music quickly palls. Louis Antoine
Jullien years ago in this country excited wild enthusiasm by his
<i>Firemen&rsquo;s Quadrille</i>, in which a conflagration, the bells, the rush of
the firemen, the squirting and the shout of the foreman, &ldquo;Wash
her, Thirteen!&rdquo; were graphically portrayed.</p>
<p>But there is majestic poetry in great machines, even in railway
engines. One of Turner&rsquo;s most striking pictures is the one depicting
a hare running madly across a viaduct with a pursuing locomotive
in rain and mist. What was the most poetic thing of the
Philadelphia exposition of 1876? The superb Corliss engine, epic
in strength and grandeur. Walt Whitman, Kipling, and others have
found inspiration in a locomotive; why reproach a composer for
attempting to express &ldquo;the visual impression and the physical sensation&rdquo;
of it? One may like or dislike <i>Pacific 231</i>, but it is something
more than a musical joke; it was not merely devised for
sensational effect.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>When <i>Pacific 231</i> was first performed in Paris at Koussevitzky&rsquo;s concerts,
May 8 and 15, 1924, Honegger made this commentary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always had a passionate love for locomotives. To me they&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
I love them passionately as others are passionate in their love
for horses or women&mdash;are like living creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wanted to express in the <i>Pacific</i> is not the noise of an
engine, but the visual impression and the physical sensation of it.
These I strove to express by means of a musical composition. Its point
of departure is an objective contemplation: quiet respiration of an
engine in state of immobility; effort for moving; progressive increase
of speed, in order to pass from the &lsquo;lyric&rsquo; to the pathetic state of an
engine of three hundred tons driven in the night at a speed of one
hundred and twenty per hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a subject I have taken an engine of the &lsquo;Pacific&rsquo; type, known as
&lsquo;231,&rsquo; an engine for heavy trains of high speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other locomotive engines are classified as &ldquo;Atlantic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mogul.&rdquo; The
number 231 here refers to the number of the &ldquo;Pacific&rsquo;s&rdquo; wheels 2&mdash;3&mdash;1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a sort of rhythmic pedal sustained by the violins is built the impressive
image of an intelligent monster, a joyous giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Pacific 231</i> is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn,
two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns,
three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, snare drum, bass drum,
cymbals, tam-tam, strings.</p>
<p>The locomotive engine has been the theme of strange tales by
Dickens, Marcel Schwob, Kipling, and of Zola&rsquo;s novel, <i>La B&ecirc;te
humaine</i>. It is the hero of Abel Gance&rsquo;s film, <i>Rou&eacute;</i> for which it is said
Honegger adapted music, and the American film, <i>The Iron Horse</i>.</p>

<p>Vincent d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s music has often been charged with the atrocious
crimes of austerity and aloofness; it has been called cerebral. It is
true that d&rsquo;Indy uses his head, not loses it, in composition; that his
music will never be popular with the multitude; it lacks an obvious
appeal to those who say, with an air of finality: &ldquo;I know what I
like.&rdquo; It is not sugary; it is not theatrical. To say that it is cold is to
say that it is not effusive. D&rsquo;Indy does not gush. Nor does he permit
himself to run with a mighty stir and din to a blatant climax,
dearly loved by those who think that noise shows strength. He
respects his art and himself, and does not trim his sails to catch the
breeze of popular favor. There is a nobility in his music; there is
to those who do not wear their heart on their sleeve true warmth.
There is a soaring of the spirit, not a drooping to court favor. And
no one has ever questioned his constructive skill.</p>

<p>The majority of the pages in d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s symphony contain music
lofty and noble. Only the <i>finale</i> sinks below the prevailing high
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
level, and there are fine moments in the introduction to this <i>finale</i>.
It is natural that the influence of C&eacute;sar Franck is shown especially
in the two middle movements. So great was d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s devotion to
his master that he proudly admitted the influence; but d&rsquo;Indy was
no mere copyist; the greatest pages of the symphony are his own.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The Symphony in B flat major, composed in 1903-04, was produced
at a Lamoureux concert, Paris, February 28, 1904. The score is dedicated
to Paul Dukas. The symphony is scored for three flutes (and
piccolo), two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three
bassoons, four horns, small trumpet in E flat, two trumpets in C, three
trombones, bass trombone, chromatic kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals,
triangle, two harps, strings.</p>
<p>This symphony is without a programme of any sort. D&rsquo;Indy wrote
in an article published in the first number of <i>Musica</i> (Paris): &ldquo;Symphonic
music, unlike dramatic music, is developing toward complexity:
the dramatic element is more and more introduced into absolute music,
in such a way that form is here, as a rule, absolutely submissive to the
incidents of a veritable action.&rdquo; Mr. Calvocoressi supplies a note to this
remark: &ldquo;To search for an action that is not purely musical in absolute
music would be madness. There is, indeed, an action in this symphony,
but it is wholly in the music: the putting into play of two principal
themes, which present themselves at the beginning side by side, follow
each other, war against each other, or, on the contrary, are each
developed separately, associate with themselves new ideas which complete
or serve as commentary, and at the end of the work are blended
in an immense triumphal chant.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> It would be idle, then, to attempt
to characterize these themes as though they were dramatic motives.
One can say, however, that two decided elements of musical expression
are strongly opposed to each other.</p>
<p>The first movement is made up of two distinct parts: a slow introduction,
in which the themes appear at first in the state of simple
cells, and a lively movement.</p>
<p>I. <i>Extr&ecirc;mement lent. Tr&egrave;s vif.</i> B flat major, 4-2. Violoncellos and
double basses, doubled by harps, announce an initial and somber theme
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
of almost sluggish rhythm. The flute replies with a phrase whose chief
characteristic is an ascending leap of a seventh, a progression dear to
the composer. This phrase is the second principal theme of the symphony.
The phrase may be resolved in this instance into two distinct
elements: the descending fourth&mdash;B flat to F sharp&mdash;which, with its
own peculiar rhythm, is a cell that later on will assume great importance;
the ascending seventh, which will play a dominating part and
appear again throughout the work as a song of despair, a burst of the
determined will. The second theme may then be considered as a sort
of embryonic form which contains the chief elements of the symphony.
The initial theme, on the contrary, will almost always keep a closer
resemblance to itself; there will be numberless changes, melodic or
rhythmic transformations, but its particular physiognomy will not be
lost.</p>
<p>A <i>tutti</i> of some measures leads by a rapid <i>crescendo</i> to the main
body, <i>tr&egrave;s vif</i>, 3-4. A horn, accompanied by second violins and violas,
announces a new theme, which belongs exclusively to this movement.
The first two notes of this motive are the descending fourth, the first
cell of the second chief theme. The second section of the new theme
furnishes material for an abrupt and jerky figure, given soon afterwards
to the wood-wind.</p>
<p>II. <i>Mod&eacute;r&eacute;ment lent.</i> D flat major, 6-4. The second movement
begins with an announcement by the first violins of the second principal
theme (descending fourth). The bass clarinet sings the rest of
the motive, which is taken up by the strings. These first measures prepare
the re&euml;ntrance of the same theme under a form (6-4) already used
in the first movement. A new figure appears, which will be found in
the <i>finale</i>. The development brings a modulation to E major, and
harps give out a strongly rhythmed motive in that tonality. This motive
will be employed in the <i>scherzo</i>. The dotted, characteristic rhythm is
now kept up, while the oboe, then the clarinet, and also other instruments,
sing in turn an expressive theme; on the conclusion of it is the
first new theme of this movement, which in turn is a prolongation of
the theme (6-4) of the first movement.</p>
<p>III. <i>Mod&eacute;r&eacute;</i>, D minor, 2-4. A solo viola chants a theme of archaic
character, which reminds one of some old legend&rsquo;s air. The flute hints
at the strongly rhythmed theme of the preceding movement, but the
archaic tune is developed and interrupted suddenly by the horns proclaiming
the initial theme, sadly changed and of greatly diminished
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
importance. There is a fantastic whirlwind in the strings, and above
it a bold theme is given out by the wood-wind. The strongly rhythmed
theme appears almost immediately afterwards, and is added to the
whirling triplets. There is a comparative lull, and the bold theme is
now given out at length by the small trumpet, after which there is an
orchestral explosion. Then the archaic tune appears, rhythmed curiously
in 3-8, &ldquo;after the manner of a pantomimic dance,&rdquo; and played by flutes
and then bassoons; harp harmonics and the triangle give additional
color to this episode.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Introduction, fugue, et finale.</i> The general form of this last movement
is that of a rondo preceded by an introduction in two parts
(introduction and fugue). In the introduction to the fugue all the
chief thematic ideas of the preceding movements are recalled one by
one, either by solo instruments or by groups of instruments.</p>
<p>The subject of the fugue is the expressive theme first sung by the
oboe in the second movement, but now the theme is lengthened by an
ascending arabesque. The final association of the two themes, already
hinted at the beginning of the second movement by the appearance
of a figure common to them both, is now frankly declared. This subject,
persisting to the end of the fugue, brings in a lively movement,
5-4, the true <i>finale</i>. The oboe sings the first new theme of the second
movement. The instrumental complications become more elaborate.
The strongly rhythmed theme presents itself, and then a brand-new
motive appears, interrupted by echoes of the archaic melody. This new
theme prepares the return of the initial motive, which strengthens itself
in canon form. The fugue subject creeps about the whole orchestra,
while a more aggressive form of the often used theme of the second
movement soars above. The brand-new theme returns, and once more
ushers in the initial theme in the bass, while the second chief or cyclic
theme is announced above. This is the final struggle of the two. The
fugue subject soon reappears, and leads to a brilliant burst of the
whole orchestra. The second chief or cyclic theme is then used as a
broadly proportioned chorale, whose bass is the initial theme, now
subdued and definitely associated with the triumph of the second
theme. This triumph is thrice proclaimed in the peroration, and, between
the proclamations, the archaic theme, with its characteristic
initial fifth, is heard in the wood-wind.</p>

<h2 id="c72"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONIC VARIATIONS, &ldquo;ISTAR,&rdquo; OP. 42</span></h2>
<p><i>Istar</i>, the <i>Symphony on a Mountain Air</i>, and <i>A Summer Day on
the Mountain</i> were composed in the period of d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s life when
he was concerned chiefly with making music, and not telling young
composers how it should be made. Those three compositions, with
the Symphony in B flat major, will represent him honorably in the
years to come. One should not underrate his work as a teacher,
his high ideals. His technic did not leave him in his later works,
but his brain was more in evidence than any source of emotion.
Maurice Boucher, speaking of Debussy being drawn instinctively
toward the French poets contemporaneous with him (the poems
of Rossetti and the dramas of Maeterlinck also attracted him) said
that d&rsquo;Indy &ldquo;by his temperament was borne toward doctrinal discussions.&rdquo;
In <i>Istar</i>, though his technical skill is brilliantly in evidence,
there is pure music from the beginning to the end. It is true
that the withholding of the theme in its full glory to the end might
be called a &ldquo;stunt,&rdquo; as Ravel&rsquo;s <i>Bolero</i> is a stunt, but d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s is the
legitimate, inevitable crowning of the work; Ravel&rsquo;s was designed
chiefly to create curiosity with a final surprise, and the <i>Bolero</i> once
known does not bear repeated hearings, for the effect, once known,
is afterward discounted if not wholly lost.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This composition was first brought out in Brussels, and led by
Eug&egrave;ne Ysaye, on January 10, 1897; it was performed in Chicago and
led by Theodore Thomas on April 23, 1898. The variations&mdash;the work
is practically a symphonic poem&mdash;are scored for piccolo, two flutes, two
oboes, English horn, two clarinets and bass clarinet, three bassoons,
four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums,
cymbals, triangle, two harps, and strings. They are dedicated to the
Orchestral Society of the Ysaye Concerts.</p>
<p>William Foster Apthorp translated the verses on the title-page as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The variations begin <i>tr&egrave;s lent</i>, F minor, 4-4, with a somber motive
(first horn). The violas and clarinets, accompanied by wood-wind instruments
in syncopated rhythm, answer with a second motive, and
there is a modulation to F major. The variations, as Mr. Apthorp says,
have one wholly original peculiarity: &ldquo;The theme is not given out
simply at the beginning, neither is it heard in its entirety until the
last variation, in which it is sung by various groups of instruments in
unison and octaves, and worked up later in full harmony. Each one
of the variations represents one of the seven stages of Istar&rsquo;s being
disrobed at the gates of the &lsquo;immutable land,&rsquo; until in the last she
stands forth in the full splendor of nudity. The composition is so free
as to resent technical analysis; but by following the poem, and noting
the garment or ornament taken off, the listener can appreciate the composer&rsquo;s
poetic or picturesque suggestiveness in his music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. Lambinet, a professor at a Bordeaux public school, chose in 1905
the text &ldquo;Pro Musica&rdquo; for his prize-day speech. He told the boys that
the first thing the study of music would teach them would be logic. &ldquo;In
symphonic development logic plays as great a part as sentiment. The
theme is a species of axiom, full of musical truth, whence proceed
deductions. The musician deals with sounds as the geometrician with
lines and the dialectician with arguments.&rdquo; The master went on to remark:
&ldquo;A great modern composer, M. Vincent d&rsquo;Indy, has reversed the
customary process in his symphonic poem <i>Istar</i>. He by degrees unfolds
from initial complexity the simple idea which was wrapped up therein,
and appears only at the close, like Isis unveiled, like a scientific law
discovered and formulated.&rdquo; The speaker found this happy definition
for such a musical work&mdash;&ldquo;an inductive symphony.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c73"><span class="h2line1">FRANZ</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LISZT</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Raiding, near Oedenburg, Hungary, October 22, 1811; died at Bayreuth, July 31, 1886)</p>
<p>Liszt suffered as a composer from foolish adulation and still
more absurd denunciation. It was not so many years ago that
otherwise fair-minded musicians, professors in conservatories, composers
of smug, respectable music, pianists and violinists of nimble
fingers and lukewarm blood, would leave the concert hall with an
air whenever one of Liszt&rsquo;s works was about to be performed.
Liszt also suffered from admiring friends who helped themselves
to his musical thoughts, to his new forms of musical expression,
and using them for their own advantage, were applauded by the
crowd, while Liszt himself was ignored or flouted. How much
of Liszt there is in Richard Wagner&rsquo;s best!</p>
<p>Programme music has existed from the early days of the art. No
doubt David&rsquo;s performance before Saul had some definite programme;
but the symphonic poem as it is now known was invented
and shaped by Liszt, and he has influenced in this respect composers
of every nation. The modern Russians all hark back to Berlioz
and Liszt. The more recent Germans and even the modern
French were made possible by this Hungarian, who, in Paris,
Weimar, or Rome, was first of all a citizen of the world. In the
mass of his compositions there is mysticism that is vague and insignificant;
there is affected simplicity that is as childish prattle;
there is pathos that is bathos; eloquence sometimes degenerates
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
into bombast; there is frequently the odor of tanbark, the vision
of the ringmaster cracking his whip and the man in tights and
spangles leaping through paper hoops or kissing his hand from
the trapeze. Liszt was first famous as a virtuoso, and as Edward
MacDowell once said, in every virtuoso there is the possibility of
the rope dancer; it is in his blood.</p>
<p>The faults of Liszt as a composer are open to everyone. When
they lie in the music for the piano they have been too often exaggerated
by the &ldquo;Liszt pupil.&rdquo; Nor have orchestral conductors always
been fortunate in the interpretation of the greater works;
they have been intoxicated by the pomp or fury and were unable
to draw the line between sonority and vulgarity.</p>
<p>We are inclined to judge a master of years gone by as though
he were a contemporary, and forgetting that he in his day was a
daring innovator, a revolutionary, we cry out against his music as
trite and moribund. Certain forms of Liszt&rsquo;s expression, forms that
recall the reign of Rossini or Meyerbeer, are now distasteful to us,
as are certain formulas of Wagner. Excessive modernity contains
the seeds of early death. But the architecture that Liszt devised is
still strong and beautiful, and is today a model for others who delight
in strange ornamentation. The world of music owes Liszt a
debt that it will be long in paying, and, as other debtors, it often
forgets what it owes and abuses the creditor.</p>
<p>The years go by and the generosity, the loving-kindness, the
nobility of Liszt, the man, are more and more clearly revealed. His
purse, advice, assistance were ever ready. He would not cringe or
flatter. His art was a religion. He was one of the very few composers
that stood at ease in the presence of the mighty and were
not snobbish toward the unfortunate, the misunderstood, the unappreciated.
As a man in the world of his art he is therefore to be
ranked with Handel and Hector Berlioz.</p>

<h2 id="c74"><span class="h2line1">A &ldquo;FAUST&rdquo; SYMPHONY IN THREE CHARACTER PICTURES (AFTER GOETHE)</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>Faust</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Gretchen</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Mephistopheles</dd></dl>
<p>Perhaps in the first movement there are a few passages that
might be cut out or condensed, but no one would wish the movement
&ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; to be changed in any way; of all the music that
is associated with the innocent maiden of Goethe&rsquo;s poem, this is
surely the most expressive, the most beautiful. The remorseful,
crazed Gretchen is not in Liszt&rsquo;s picture. We find her in the prison
music of Bo&iuml;to. And how paltry does the music of Mephistopheles
conceived by Gounod seem in comparison with the ironical fiend
of Liszt, mocking the doubts and the aspirations of the disillusionized
philosopher!</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Liszt told his biographer, Lina Ramann,<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> that the idea of this
symphony came to him in Paris in the &rsquo;forties, and was suggested by
Berlioz&rsquo;s <i>Damnation of Faust</i>. (Berlioz&rsquo;s work was produced at the
Op&eacute;ra-Comique, December 6, 1846.) Lina Ramann&rsquo;s biography is eminently
unsatisfactory, and in some respects untrustworthy, but there
is no reason to doubt her word in this instance. Some have said that
Liszt was inspired by Ary Scheffer&rsquo;s pictures to illustrate Goethe&rsquo;s
<i>Faust</i>. Peter Cornelius stated that Liszt was incited to his work by
seeing the pictures &ldquo;in which Scheffer had succeeded in giving a bodily
form to the three leading characters in Goethe&rsquo;s poem.&rdquo; As a matter
of fact, we believe, Scheffer did not portray Mephistopheles. Scheffer
(1795-1858) was a warm friend of Liszt, and made a portrait of him
in 1837, which is in the Liszt Museum at Weimar.</p>
<p>But Liszt made in the &rsquo;forties no sketches of his symphony. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
music was composed in 1853-54; it was revised in 1857, when the final
chorus was added. The <i>Faust</i> symphony is scored for three flutes (and
piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three
trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, cymbals, triangle,
harp, strings, and male chorus with tenor solo. In the revised and
unpublished version the bass clarinet is used, but only for a few
measures.</p>
<p>Miss Ramann admits frankly that the symphony is, without the final
chorus, merely a series of musical &ldquo;Faust pictures,&rdquo; as the pictures by
Kaulbach, Kreling, and others, are in art; but without the chorus it
does not reproduce the lyrical contents of the main idea of the poem
itself.</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo; Some find in this movement five leading motives, each
one of which portrays a characteristic of Faust or one of his fixed
moods. The more conservative speak of first and second themes, subsidiary
themes, and conclusion themes. However the motives are
ticketed or numbered, they appear later in various metamorphoses.</p>
<p>The movement begins with a long introduction, <i>lento assai</i>, 4-4. &ldquo;A
chain of dissonances,&rdquo; with free use of augmented fifths (muted violas
and violoncellos), has been described as the &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; theme, and the
bold greater seventh (oboe) is also supposed to portray Faust, the
disappointed philosopher. &ldquo;These motives have here the expression of
perplexed musing and painful regret at the vanity of the efforts made
for the realization of cherished aspirations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An <i>allegro impetuoso</i>, 4-4. Violins attack, and, after the interruption
of reeds and horns, rush along and are joined by wind instruments.
The &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; motive is sounded. The music grows more and more
intense. A bassoon, <i>lento assai</i>, gives out the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; motive and introduces
the main body of the movement:</p>
<p><i>Allegro agitato ed appassionato assai</i>, C minor, 4-4. The first theme,
a violently agitated motive, is of kin in character to a leading theme of
the composer&rsquo;s symphonic poem, <i>Prometheus</i>, which was composed in
1850 and revised in 1855. This theme comes here for the first time,
except for one figure, a rising inflection at the end of the first phrase,
which has been heard in the introduction. It is developed at length,
and is repeated in a changed form by the whole orchestra. A new
theme enters in passionate appeal (oboes and clarinets in dialogue with
bassoons, violoncellos, and double basses), while the first violins bring
back the sixteenth note figure of the first theme of the main section.
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
This second theme with subsidiary passage-work leads to an episode,
<i>meno mosso, misterioso e molto tranquillo</i>, 6-4. The &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; theme
in the introduction is developed in modulating sequence by clarinet
and some of the strings, while there are sustained harmonies in wind
instruments and ascending passages in muted violins and violas. But
the &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; theme has not its original and gnarled form: it is calmer
in line and it is more remote. Another theme comes in, <i>affettuoso poco
andante</i>, E major, 7-4 (3-4, 4-4), which has been called the &ldquo;Love&rdquo;
theme, as typical of Faust with Gretchen. This theme is based on the
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; motive heard near the beginning of the introduction from
wind instruments. In this movement it is said to portray Gretchen,
while in the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; movement it portrays Faust; and this theme
is burlesqued continually in the third movement, &ldquo;Mephistopheles.&rdquo;
The short theme given to wind instruments is interrupted by a figure
for solo viola, which later in the symphony becomes a part of the
theme itself. The &ldquo;Faust-Gretchen&rdquo; motive is developed in wood-wind
and horns, with figures for violins and violas. Passage-work follows,
and parts of the first theme appear, <i>allegro con fuoco</i>, 4-4. The music
grows more and more passionate, and the rhythm of the wind instruments
more pronounced. There is a transition section, and the basses
allude to the last of the themes, the fifth according to some, the conclusion
theme as others prefer, <i>grandioso, poco meno mosso</i>, which is
given out <i>fortissimo</i> by the full orchestra. It is based on the initial
figure of the violas and violoncellos in the introduction. The exposition
section of the movement is now complete. The free fantasia, if the
following section may be so called, begins with the return of &ldquo;<i>tempo
primo&mdash;allegro agitato assai</i>,&rdquo; and the working out of thematic material
is elaborate. There is a repetition section, or rather a recapitulation
of the first, third, and fourth themes. The <i>coda</i> ends sadly with the
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; motive in augmentation.</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;Gretchen.&rdquo; <i>Andante soave</i>, A flat major, 3-4. The movement
has an introduction (flutes and clarinets), which establishes a mood.
The chief theme, &ldquo;characteristic of the innocence, simplicity, and contented
happiness of Gretchen,&rdquo; may be called the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; theme.
It is sung (<i>dolce semplice</i>) by the oboe with only a solo viola accompaniment.
The theme is then given to other instruments and with
another accompaniment. The repeated phrase of flutes and clarinet,
answered by violins, is supposed by some commentators to have reference
to Gretchen&rsquo;s plucking the flower, with the words, &ldquo;He loves
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
me&mdash;loves me not,&rdquo; and at last, &ldquo;He loves me!&rdquo; The chief theme enters
after this passage, and it now has a fuller expression and deeper significance.
A second theme, typical of Gretchen, is sung by first violins,
<i>dolce amoroso</i>; it is more emotional, more sensuous. Here there is a
suggestion of a figure in the introduction. This theme brings the end
to the first section, which is devoted exclusively to Gretchen.</p>
<p>Faust now enters, and his typical motive is heard (horn with agitated
viola and violoncello accompaniment). The &ldquo;Faust-Gretchen&rdquo; motive
of the first movement is used, but in a very different form. The restless
theme of the opening movement is now one of enthusiastic love.
The striking modulations that followed the first &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; theme
occur again, but in different keys, and Faust soon leaves the scene. The
third section of the movement is a much modified repetition of the
first section. Gretchen now has memories of her love. A tender violin
figure now winds about her theme. Naturally, the &ldquo;He loves me&mdash;loves
me not&rdquo; music is omitted, but there is a reminiscence of the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
motive.</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;Mephistopheles.&rdquo; Mephistopheles is here the spirit of demoniacal
irony. Mr. Apthorp, after saying that the prevalence of triple
rhythms in the movement might lead one, but in vain, to look for
something of the <i>scherzo</i> form in it, adds: &ldquo;One may suspect the composer
of taking Mephisto&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Ich bin der Geist der stets verneint</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;I am
the spirit that denies&rsquo;) for the motto of this movement; somewhat in
the sense of A. W. Ambros when he said of Jacques Offenbach in speaking
of his opera-bouffes: &lsquo;All the subjects which artists have hitherto
turned to account, and in which they have sought their ideals, must
here be pushed <i>ad absurdum</i>; we feel as if Mephisto were ironically
smiling at us in the elegant mask of &ldquo;a man of the times,&rdquo; and asking
us whether the whole baggage of the Antique and the Romantic were
worth a rap.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">It is not at all improbable that Liszt took the idea of Mephistopheles
parodying the themes of Faust and Gretchen from the caricature of
the motive of the fixed idea and from the mockery of the once loved
one in the <i>finale</i> of Berlioz&rsquo;s <i>Episode in the Life of an Artist</i>, or <i>Fantastic</i>
symphony.</p>
<p>There are no new themes introduced in the &ldquo;Mephistopheles&rdquo; movement.</p>
<p>As Miss Ramann says, Mephistopheles&rsquo; character in this music is to
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
be without character. His sport is to mock Faust as typified by his
themes; but he has no power over the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; themes, and they
are left undisturbed.</p>
<p>Ernest Newman<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> finds the &ldquo;Mephistopheles&rdquo; section particularly
ingenious. &ldquo;It consists, for the most part, of a kind of burlesque upon
the subjects of the <i>Faust</i> which are here passed, as it were, through a
continuous fire of irony and ridicule. This is a far more effective way
of depicting &lsquo;the spirit of denial&rsquo; than making him mouth a farrago
of pantomime bombast, in the manner of Bo&iuml;to. The being who exists,
for the purpose of the drama, only in endeavoring to frustrate every
good impulse of Faust&rsquo;s soul, is really best dealt with, in music, not as a
positive individuality, but as the embodiment of negation&mdash;a malicious,
saturnine parody of all the good that has gone to the making of Faust.
The &lsquo;Mephistopheles&rsquo; is not only a piece of diabolically clever music,
but the best picture we have of a character that in the hands of the
average musician becomes either stupid, or vulgar, or both. As we
listen to Liszt&rsquo;s music, we feel that we really have the Mephistopheles
of Goethe&rsquo;s drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Allegro vivace ironico</i>, C major, 2-4. There is a short pictorial introduction,
an ascending chromatic run (violoncellos and double basses,
chords for wood-wind, strings, with cymbals and triangle). There are
ironical forms of the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; motives, and the <i>sempre
allegro</i> in which these themes appear leads to the main body of the
movement, <i>allegro vivace</i>, 6-8, 2-4. The theme is the first of the first
movement, and it now appears in a wildly excited form. Interrupted by
the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; motive, it goes on with still greater stress and fury.
Transitional passages in the movement return in strange disguise. An
episode <i>un poco animato</i> follows with an abrupt use of the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
motive, and the &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo; motive, reappearing, is greeted with jeers
and fiendish laughter. The violas have a theme evolved from the
&ldquo;Faust&rdquo; motive, which is then given to the violins and becomes the
subject of fugal treatment. <i>Allegro animato</i>; the grandiose fifth, or conclusion,
theme of the first movement is now handled most flippantly.
There is a tempestuous <i>crescendo</i>, and then silence; muted horns sustain
the chord of C minor, while strings <i>pizzicati</i> give out the &ldquo;Inquiry&rdquo;
motive. &ldquo;The passage is as a warning apparition.&rdquo; The hellish
mockery breaks out again. Some find the music now inspired by an
episode in Goethe&rsquo;s Walpurgis scene. In the midst of the din, wood-wind
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
instruments utter a cry, as when Faust exclaimed, &ldquo;Mephistopheles,
do you see yonder a pale, beautiful child, standing alone?...
I must confess it seems to me that she looks like the good Gretchen.&rdquo;
The music ascends in the violins, grows softer and softer. <i>Andante</i>; the
oboe sings the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; theme. The vision quickly fades. Again
an outbreak of despair, and there is a recapitulation of preceding musical
matter. In the <i>allegro non troppo</i> the &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; theme is chiefly used.
&ldquo;And then things grow more and more desperate, till we come to
what we may call the transformation scene. It is like the rolling and
shifting of clouds, and, indeed, transports us from the abode of mortal
man to more ethereal spheres.&rdquo; The wild dissonances disappear; there
is a wonderful succession of sustained chords. <i>Poco andante, ma sempre
alla breve</i>: the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; theme is colored mysteriously; trombones
make solemn declaration. Gretchen is now Faust&rsquo;s redeemer. The
male chorus, <i>Chorus mysticus</i>, accompanied by organ and strings, sings
to the strain announced by the trombones, <i>andante mistico</i>, the lines
of Goethe:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Alles Verg&auml;ngliche</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Ist nur ein Gleichniss;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Das Unzul&auml;ngliche,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Hier wird&rsquo;s Erreigniss;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Das Unbeschreibliche,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Hier ist&rsquo;s gethan;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Das Ewig-Weibliche</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Zieht uns hinan.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The solo tenor and chorus sing: &ldquo;<i>Das Ewig-Weibliche zieht uns
hinan</i>&rdquo; (with the &ldquo;Gretchen&rdquo; motive rhythmically altered and with harp
added to the accompaniment), and the work ends radiantly calm.</p>
<p>These lines have been Englished in prose: &ldquo;All that is transitory is
only a simile; the insufficient here becomes event; the indescribable is
here done; the Ever feminine draws us onward.&rdquo; It was Liszt&rsquo;s intention,
Brendel tells us, to have this chorus invisible at the first performance,
but, inasmuch as it would have been necessary at Weimar
to have it sung behind the lowered curtain, he feared the volume would
be too weak.</p>

<h2 id="c75"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONIC POEM, NO. 3, &ldquo;LES PR&Eacute;LUDES&rdquo; (AFTER LAMARTINE)</span></h2>
<p>According to statements of Richard Pohl, this symphonic poem was
begun at Marseilles in 1834 and completed at Weimar in 1850, According
to L. Ramann&rsquo;s chronological catalogue of Liszt&rsquo;s works, <i>The Preludes</i>
was composed in 1854 and published in 1856.</p>
<p>Theodor M&uuml;ller-Reuter says that the poem was composed at Weimar
in 1849-50 from sketches made in earlier years, and this statement
seems to be the correct one.</p>
<p>Ramann tells the following story about the origin of <i>The Preludes</i>.
Liszt, it seems, began to compose at Paris, about 1844, choral music
for a poem by Aubray, and the work was entitled <i>Les 4 &Eacute;l&eacute;ments</i> (<i>la
Terre</i>, <i>les Aquilons</i>, <i>les Flots</i>, <i>les Astres</i>). The cold stupidity of the
poem discouraged him, and he did not complete the cantata. He told
his troubles to Victor Hugo, in the hope that the poet would take the
hint and write for him; but Hugo did not or would not understand his
meaning, so Liszt put the music aside. Early in 1854 he thought of
using the abandoned work for a Pension Fund concert of the Court
Orchestra at Weimar, and it then occurred to make the music, changed
and enlarged, illustrative of a passage in Lamartine&rsquo;s <i>Nouvelles M&eacute;ditations
po&eacute;tiques, XVme M&eacute;ditation: &ldquo;Les Pr&eacute;ludes,&rdquo;</i> dedicated to Victor
Hugo.</p>
<p>The symphonic poem <i>Les Pr&eacute;ludes</i> was performed for the first time
in the Grand Ducal Court Theater, Weimar, at a concert for the Pension
Fund of the widows and orphans of deceased members of the
Court Orchestra on February 23, 1854. Liszt conducted from manuscript.</p>
<p>Liszt revised <i>Les Pr&eacute;ludes</i> in 1853 or 1854. The score was published
in May, 1856; the orchestral parts, in January, 1865.</p>
<p>The alleged passage from Lamartine that serves as a motto has thus
been Englished:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is our life but a series of preludes to that unknown song, the
first solemn note of which is sounded by death? Love forms the enchanted
daybreak of every life; but what is the destiny where the first
delights of happiness are not interrupted by some storm, whose fatal
breath dissipates its fair illusions, whose fell lightning consumes its
altar? and what wounded spirit, when one of its tempests is over, does
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
not seek to rest its memories in the sweet calm of country life? Yet
man does not resign himself long to enjoy the beneficent tepidity which
first charmed him on Nature&rsquo;s bosom; and when &lsquo;the trumpet&rsquo;s loud
clangor has called him to arms,&rsquo; he rushes to the post of danger, whatever
may be the war that calls him to the ranks, to find in battle the
full consciousness of himself and the complete possession of his
strength.&rdquo; There is little in Lamartine&rsquo;s poem that suggests this
preface. The quoted passage beginning &ldquo;The trumpet&rsquo;s loud clangor&rdquo; is
Lamartine&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>La trompette a jet&eacute; le signal des alarmes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Preludes</i> is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes, two
clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass
tuba, kettledrums, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, harp, and strings.</p>
<h2 id="c76"><span class="h2line1">PIANOFORTE CONCERTO, NO. 1, IN E FLAT</span></h2>
<p>Liszt&rsquo;s E flat concerto, long the subject of scurrilous criticism because
forsooth a triangle was indicated in the score, has long been
the virtuoso concerto <i>par excellence</i>. But its virtuosity is of an unusual
order. It does not display its innate quality to the precise and
composed technician; it cannot be played complacently or casually.
It demands an audacious, unhesitating bravura, large rhetorical
phrases, bold accents, and a careless contempt for its difficulties. Its
octave <i>cadenzas</i> suggest the remorseless dash of an eagle upon its
prey.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This concerto was completed probably in 1848 or 1849, from sketches
made in the early &rsquo;forties. According to a letter of Hans von B&uuml;low&rsquo;s,
the concerto was completed in June, 1849. Revised in 1853, it was published
in 1857. The first performance was at Weimar, at a Court concert
in the hall of the Grand Duke&rsquo;s palace (during the Berlioz week),
on February 17, 1855; Liszt, pianist; B&uuml;low, conductor. The concerto
is dedicated to Henri Litolff. The orchestral part is scored for piccolo,
two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two
trumpets, three trombones, kettledrums, cymbals, triangle, and the usual
strings.</p>
<p>The form is free. A few important themes are exposed, developed;
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
they undergo many transformations in rhythm and tempo. The first
and leading theme is at once given out imperatively by the strings, with
interrupting chords of wood-wind and brass. This is the theme to
which Liszt used to sing: &ldquo;<i>Das versteht ihr alle nicht!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;according to
B&uuml;low and Ramann, &ldquo;<i>Ihr K&ouml;nnt alle nichts</i>.&rdquo; This theme may be taken
as the motto of the concerto. <i>Allegro maestoso, tempo giusto</i>, 4-4. The
second theme, B major, <i>quasi adagio</i>, 12-8, is first announced by muted
violoncellos and double basses and then developed elaborately by the
pianoforte. There are hints of this theme in the preceding section.
The third theme, E flat minor, <i>allegretto vivace</i>, 3-4, in the nature of
a <i>scherzo</i>, is first given to the strings, with preliminary warning and
answers of the triangle, which, the composer says, should be struck
with delicately rhythmic precision. The fourth theme is rather an
answer to the chief phrase of the second than an individual motive.
The <i>scherzo</i> tempo changes to <i>allegro animato</i>, 4-4, in which use is
made chiefly of the motto theme. The final section is an <i>allegro
marziale animato</i>, which quickens to a final <i>presto</i>.</p>
<p>The introduction of the triangle in the score caused great offense in
Vienna. Hanslick damned the work by characterizing it as a &ldquo;&lsquo;Triangle&rsquo;
concerto,&rdquo; when Pruckner played it there in the season of 1856-57.
It was not heard again in that city until 1869, when Sophie Menter
insisted on playing it. Liszt wrote a letter in 1857 describing the concerto
and defending his use of the triangle.</p>

<h2 id="c78"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;A PAGAN POEM&rdquo; (AFTER VIRGIL), OP. 14, FOR ORCHESTRA, PIANOFORTE, ENGLISH HORN, AND THREE TRUMPETS OBBLIGATI</span></h2>
<p>The music of the <i>Pagan Poem</i> is highly imaginative. Its pages are
pages of beauty and passion. The strangeness of the opening is not
forced or experimental. The composer himself first saw in his
mind&rsquo;s eye the scene and heard the sorcerer&rsquo;s chant. And here is
no love song of familiar type given to caterwauling &rsquo;cellos. There
is no conventional lament of approved crape and tears. A dolorous
theme, broadly and nobly thought, is sung by the English horn.
The spell works. Daphnis now hastens toward the long empty and
expectant arms. There is frantic and amorous exultation.</p>
<p>In this instance a rich and rare orchestral dress covers a well
shaped and vigorous body.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This tone poem was suggested to Mr. Loeffler by certain verses in
the eighth Eclogue of Virgil, which is sometimes known as &ldquo;Pharmaceutria&rdquo;
(the Sorceress). The Eclogue, dedicated to Pollio, was written
probably in 39 <span class="small">B.C.</span> It consists of two love songs, that of Damon and
that of Alphesib&oelig;us. Each song has ten parts, and these parts are
divided by a recurring burden or refrain. Alphesib&oelig;us tells of the love
incantation of a Thessalian girl, who by the aid of magical spells
endeavors to bring back to her cottage her truant lover Daphnis. Virgil
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
helped himself freely here from the second Idyll of Theocritus, &ldquo;The
Sorceress,&rdquo; in which Simaetha, a Syracuse maiden of middle rank,
weaves spells to regain the love of Delphis.</p>
<p>Mr. Loeffler does not intend to present in this music a literal translation
of Virgil&rsquo;s verse into tones. The poem is a fantasy, inspired by the
verses.</p>
<p>The poem opens, <i>adagio</i>, 2-2, with a short motive, which, with an
inversion of it, is much used throughout the work. The first chief
theme is announced dolce, <i>mezzo-forte</i>, by viola solo and three flutes.
It may be called the theme of invocation. The latter half of it may be
divided into two motives, the first a phrase descending in whole tones,
the second a rising and falling wail. These two motives are used separately
and frequently in all sorts of ways. After the exposition of this
theme the pianoforte enters <i>fortissimo</i> with a harmonized inversion of
the introductory motive; a <i>crescendo</i> follows with use of the foregoing
thematic material, and a <i>glissando</i> for the pianoforte leads to an <i>allegro</i>,
in which now familiar thematic material is used until the second theme
appears (first violins, harp, pianoforte). This theme is developed. A
pianoforte <i>cadenza</i> built on thematic material leads to a <i>lento assai</i>,
6-4, with a dolorous theme (No. 3) for the English horn. The trumpets
behind the scenes give out the burden of the sorceress. The <i>pi&ugrave; vivo</i>
section may suggest to some a chase of wolves (&ldquo;I have often seen
Moeris become a wolf and plunge into the forest&rdquo;). <i>Tranquillo</i>: a
fourth theme, 4-4, is given to the pianoforte. <i>Calando</i>: the refrain is
heard again from behind the scenes. <i>Moderato</i>: the second chief theme,
6-4, now appears, and it is used extensively. <i>Largamente</i>: the trumpets,
now on the stage, announce the coming of Daphnis, and there is the
suggestion of the barking Hylax. The ending is a fanfare of frantic
exultation.</p>
<p>This poem, dedicated to the memory of Gustave Schirmer, was written
originally in 1901 for performance as chamber music.</p>
<p>In 1905 and 1906 the work was remoulded and treated much more
symphonically. The first public performance was by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra in Boston on November 23, 1927, Mr. Gebhard
pianist.</p>
<p>The poem is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three
trumpets (and three trumpets off-stage), three trombones, bass tuba,
kettledrums, glockenspiel, tam-tam, harp, pianoforte, strings.</p>

<h2 id="c80"><span class="h2line1">ORCHESTRAL SUITE NO. 2, IN E MINOR, &ldquo;INDIAN,&rdquo; OP. 48</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>Legend</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Love Song</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>In War Time</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">IV. </span>Dirge</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">V. </span>Village Festival</dd></dl>
<p>The music has the characteristic force and tenderness of this composer
when he was writing for himself and not directly for the
general public. It is not necessary to lug in any question of whether
this be distinctively American music, for the best pages of the suite
are not parochial&mdash;they are not national.</p>
<p>They are universal in their appeal to sensitive hearers of any
land. The movements that are the most poetically imaginative, that
have the greatest distinction, are the &ldquo;Legend,&rdquo; &ldquo;In War Time,&rdquo;
and above all the &ldquo;Dirge.&rdquo; Music like this would honor any composer
of whatever race he might be.</p>
<p>This lamentation might be that of the dying race. There is nothing
of the luxury of woe; there is no conventional music for
&ldquo;threadbare crape and tears.&rdquo; There is the dignity of man who has
been familiar with nature, who has known the voices of the day
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
and of the night on lonely prairie and in somber forest. There is
serene yielding to fate.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This suite was composed in 1891-92. The first performance in public
was by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the Metropolitan Opera
House, New York, January 23, 1896.</p>
<p>The Indian themes used in the suite are as follows:</p>
<p>1. First theme, Iroquois. There is also a small Chippewa theme.</p>
<p>2. Iowa love song.</p>
<p>3. A well-known song among tribes of the Atlantic coast. There is a
Dacota theme, and there are characteristic features of the Iroquois
scalp dance.</p>
<p>4. Kiowa (woman&rsquo;s song of mourning for her absent son).</p>
<p>5. Women&rsquo;s dance, war song, both Iroquois.</p>
<p>The suite is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, a
set of three kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, and strings.</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;Legend&rdquo;: Not fast; with much dignity and character, E minor,
2-2. It has been said that this movement was suggested to the composer
by Thomas Bailey Aldrich&rsquo;s Indian legend, &ldquo;Miantowona&rdquo;; but
MacDowell took no pains to follow Aldrich&rsquo;s poem incident by incident,
nor to tell any particular story; &ldquo;the poem merely suggested to
him to write something of a similar character in music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;Love Song&rdquo;: Not fast; tenderly, A major, 6-8. One chief theme,
which is announced immediately by the wood-wind, is developed, with
the use of two subsidiary phrases, one a sort of response from the
strings, the other a more assertive melody, first given out in D minor
by wood-wind instruments.</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;In War Time&rdquo;: With rough vigor, almost savagely, D minor,
2-4. The chief theme is played by two flutes, in unison, unaccompanied.
Two clarinets, in unison and without accompaniment, answer
in a subsidiary theme. This material is worked out elaborately in a
form that has the characteristics of the <i>rondo</i>. The rhythm changes
frequently towards the end from 2-4 to 6-8 and back again.</p>
<p>IV. &ldquo;Dirge&rdquo;: Dirge-like, mournfully, in G minor, 4-4. The mournful
chief theme is given out by muted violins in unison, which are soon
strengthened by the violas, against repetitions of the tonic note G by
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
piccolo, flutes, and two muted horns, one on the stage, the other behind
the scenes, with occasional full harmony in groups of wind instruments.
&ldquo;The intimate relation between this theme and that of the
first movement is not to be overlooked. It is answered by the horn
behind the scenes over full harmony in the lower strings, the passage
closing with a quaint concluding phrase of the oboe.&rdquo; The development
of this theme fills the short movement.</p>
<p>V. &ldquo;Village Festival&rdquo;: Swift and light, in E major, 2-4. Several
related themes are developed. All of them are more or less derived
from that of the first movement. There are lively dance rhythms. &ldquo;But
here also the composer has been at no pains to suggest any of the
specific concomitants of Indian festivities; he has only written a movement
in which merrymakings of the sort are musically suggested.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">MAHLER</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Kalischt in Bohemia, on July 7, 1860; died at Vienna on May 18, 1911)</p>
<p>Those who without undue prejudice discuss Mahler the composer,
admitting his faults, discussing them at length, dwelling on
undeniable fine qualities, assert that his artistic life was greater than
his own musical works, which, greatly planned, did not attain fulfillment
and were often imitative. The sincerity of the composer
was never doubted; the failure to secure that for which he strove
is therefore the more pathetic.</p>
<p>He was of an intensely nervous nature. His life as a conductor&mdash;and
he was a great conductor&mdash;the feverish atmosphere of the
opera house, his going from city to city until his ability was recognized
in Vienna and later at the Metropolitan, the death of a dearly
loved child, the fact that he was a Jew, who had turned Catholic:
these, with musical intrigues and controversies from which he suffered,
gave him no mental or esthetic poise. It was his ambition to
continue the work of men he revered, Beethoven and Wagner. In
spite of his indisputable talent he was not the man to do this. In
the nearer approaches to the ideal that was in his mind he was
simply an imitator; not a convincing, not even a plausible one.</p>
<p>One has found through his symphonies restlessness that at times
becomes hysterical; reminders of Wagner, Berlioz, Strauss; melodies
in folk-song vein, often na&iuml;ve, at times beautiful, but introduced
as at random and quickly thrown aside; an overemployment
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
of the wood-winds, used too often as solo instruments; passages
for the brass which recall the fact that as a child Mahler delighted
in military bands. Sudden changes from screaming outbursts to
thin and inconsequential instrumentation; trivial moments when
the hearer anticipates the movement of a country dance; diffuseness,
prolixity that becomes boresome; an unwillingness to bring
speech to an end; seldom genuine power or eloquence; yet here
and there measures that linger in the memory.</p>
<h2 id="c82"><span class="h2line1">THE SYMPHONIES</span></h2>
<p>No. 1. D major. Begun in December, 1883; completed at Budapest
in 1888; produced at Budapest, Mahler, conductor, on November 20,
1889; published in 1898. The Budapest programme described it as a
&ldquo;symphonic poem in two parts.&rdquo; When it was performed at the
Tonk&uuml;nstler Fest at Weimar on June 3, 1894, through the insistence
of Richard Strauss and Dr. Kretzschmar, it was known as &ldquo;<i>Titan</i>&rdquo;
(after Jean Paul Richter&rsquo;s romance).</p>
<p>No. 2. C minor. Begun and completed in 1894. First performed at a
Philharmonic Concert in Berlin, Richard Strauss, conductor, on March 4,
1895. Only the three instrumental movements were then performed.
The second and third met with great favor; Mahler was called out
five times after the <i>scherzo</i>. The majority of the Berlin critics distorted
or suppressed this fact and represented the performance as a fiasco.
The whole of the symphony was performed for the first time at
Mahler&rsquo;s concert at Berlin on December 13, 1895. According to Ernst
Otto Nodnagel, the critics again behaved &ldquo;indecently&rdquo;; took the purely
orchestral movements for granted, and heard only the <i>finale</i> with the
tenor and contralto solos. One of them spoke of &ldquo;the cynical impudence
of this brutal and very latest music maker.&rdquo; Nikisch and Weingartner
were deeply impressed, and the greater part of the audience was wildly
enthusiastic.</p>
<p>No. 3. F major, known as the &ldquo;<i>Summer Morning&rsquo;s Dream</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>Programme</i>&rdquo;
symphony. Sketched in 1895, completed in 1896. Produced
piecemeal in 1896 at Berlin and Hamburg; in 1897 at Berlin. First performance
of the whole symphony at a concert of the Allgemeiner
Deutscher Musikverein at Krefeld in June, 1902. Published in 1898.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>No. 4. G major. Composed in 1899-1900. First performance at
Munich by the Kaim Orchestra on November 28, 1901. Mahler conducted.
Published in 1900.</p>
<p>No. 5. C-sharp minor, known as &ldquo;<i>The Giant</i>&rdquo; Symphony. Completed
in 1902. First performance at a G&uuml;rzenich concert in Cologne,
October 18, 1904.</p>
<p>No. 6. A minor. Composed in 1903-04. Performed under Mahler&rsquo;s
direction at the Tonk&uuml;nstler Fest at Essen on May 27, 1906. Published
in 1905.</p>
<p>No. 7. E minor. Composed in 1904-06. Produced at Prague on
September 19, 1908. Mahler conducted. Published in 1908.</p>
<p>No. 8. In two parts, with soli and double chorus; first part, hymn,
&ldquo;Veni, Creator Spiritus,&rdquo; as a sonata first movement, with double fugue;
second part, the last scenes of <i>Faust</i>, in form of an <i>adagio</i>, <i>scherzo</i>, and
<i>finale</i>. Composition begun in 1906. First performance at Munich as
&ldquo;<i>Symphony of the Thousand</i>&rdquo; on September 12, 1908, the year of publication.</p>
<p>No. 9. Begun in 1906. Produced at Vienna late in June, 1912, Bruno
Walter, conductor. The last movement is an <i>adagio</i>.</p>
<p>No. 10. Composed in 1909-10; left unfinished by Mahler. First performance
at Prague on June 6, 1924, Alex von Zemlinsky, conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Das Lied von der Erde</i>&rdquo; (Song of the Earth), a symphony in six
parts for tenor and contralto soli with orchestra, the text taken from
<i>The Chinese Flute</i>, a collection of Chinese lyrics by Hans Bethge. Composed
in 1908, first produced at Munich November 10, 1911, Bruno
Walter, conductor.</p>
<p class="tb">Some of Mahler&rsquo;s symphonies are described as programme music,
but he was no friend of realism as it is understood by Richard Strauss.
Mahler was reported as saying: &ldquo;When I conceive a great musical picture,
I always arrive at the point where I must employ the &lsquo;word&rsquo; as the
bearer of my musical idea.... My experience with the last movement
of my second symphony was such that I ransacked the literature
of the world, up to the Bible, to find the expository word.&rdquo; Though
he differed with Strauss in the matter of realistic music, he valued him
highly: &ldquo;No one should think I hold myself to be his rival. Aside from
the fact that, if his success had not opened a path for me, I should now
be looked on as a sort of monster on account of my works, I consider
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
it one of my greatest joys that my colleagues and I have found such a
comrade in fighting and creating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One reason why Mahler&rsquo;s symphonies were looked at askance by
conductors was the enormous orchestra demanded. No. 2 called for
as many strings as possible, two harps, four flutes (interchangeable
with four piccolos), four oboes (two interchangeable with two English
horns), five clarinets (one interchangeable with bass clarinet&mdash;and
when it is possible the two in E flat should be doubled in <i>fortissimo</i>
passages), four bassoons (one interchangeable with double bassoon),
six horns (and four in the distance to be added in certain passages to
the six), six trumpets (four in the distance, which may be taken from
the six), four trombones, tuba, two sets of kettledrums, bass drum,
snare drum (when possible several of them), cymbals, tam-tam of high
pitch and one of low pitch, triangle, glockenspiel, three bells, a Ruthe
(a bundle of rods to switch a drumhead), organ, two harps. In the
distance a pair of kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, triangle. Soprano
solo, contralto solo, mixed chorus.</p>
<h2 id="c83"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 5, IN C SHARP MINOR IN THREE PARTS</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>1. Dead March&mdash;with measured step&mdash;like a funeral train.</dd>
<dd class="t"><span class="cn">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly faster, passionately, wildly. &Agrave; tempo</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">&nbsp; </span>2. With stormy emotion. With utmost vehemence</dd>

<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>4. Adagietto, very slow</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">&nbsp; </span>5. Rondo finale: allegro</dd></dl>
<p>The symphony is like unto the great image that stood before
Nebuchadnezzar in a vision. &ldquo;And the form thereof was terrible.
The image&rsquo;s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver,
his belly and his thighs of brass; his legs of iron, his feet part of
iron and part of clay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are musical thoughts that are lovely and noble. By their
side are themes of a vulgarity that is masked only by adroit contrapuntal
treatment or by the blare of instrumentation which gives
a plausible and momentary importance. There is excessive reiteration
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
of subjects and devices, and the skill displayed in embellishment
and variation of orchestral color, color rather than nuance,
does not relieve the monotony. The opening is imposing, but the
chief theme of the Dead March disappoints. The first pages of the
second section, &ldquo;stormily restless,&rdquo; are a stroke of genius, the free
expression of wild imagination. There are charming ideas in the
<i>scherzo</i>, and there is also much that is only whimsical, as though
Mahler had then written solely for his own amusement, and said
to himself, &ldquo;Let us try it this way. I wonder how it will sound.&rdquo;
The <i>adagietto</i> is the most emotional portion of the work, and here
Mahler employed simple means. Here the thought and the expression
are happily wedded, nor does the ghost of Wagner, seen for a
moment smiling, forbid this union. It may be that in the <i>finale</i> the
composer could not help remembering the wondrous theme,
D major, in the <i>adagio</i> of Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth symphony; but the
resemblance is after all only a suggestion, and this <i>finale</i> in <i>rondo</i>
form, with the majestic peroration, is worked so that there is a
steady <i>crescendo</i> of interest. As a whole Mahler&rsquo;s symphony, with
its mixture of the grand and the common, with its spontaneity and
its laborious artifice, is like unto the great image referred to above.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, known to some as &ldquo;<i>The Giant</i>&rdquo; symphony, was
performed for the first time at a G&uuml;rzenich concert at Cologne, October
18, 1904. The composer conducted. There was a difference of opinion
concerning the merits of the work. A visiting critic from Munich
wrote that there was breathless silence after the first movement, &ldquo;which
proved more effectively than tremendous applause that the public was
conscious of the presence of genius.&rdquo; It is stated that after the <i>finale</i>
there was much applause; there was also hissing.</p>
<p>When the symphony was performed in certain German cities, as at
Dresden, January 27, 1905, at a symphony concert of the Royal Orchestra,
and at Berlin, February 20, 1905, at a Philharmonic concert, the programme
books contained no analytical notes and no argument of any
sort. The compilers thus obeyed the wish of the composer. Mr. Ludwig
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
Schiedermair tells us, in his <i>Gustav Mahler: eine biographisch-kritische
W&uuml;rdigung</i>, of Mahler&rsquo;s abhorrence of all programme books
for concert use, and he relates this anecdote. Mahler conducted a
performance of his Symphony in C minor at a concert of the Munich
Hugo Wolf Society. After the concert there was a supper, and in the
course of the conversation someone mentioned programme books.
&ldquo;Then was it as though lightning flashed in a joyous, sunny landscape.
Mahler&rsquo;s eyes were more brilliant than ever, his forehead
wrinkled, he sprang in excitement from the table and exclaimed in
passionate tones: &lsquo;Away with programme books, which breed false
ideas! The audience should be left to its own thoughts over the work
that is performing: it should not be forced to read during the performance;
it should not be prejudiced in any manner. If a composer by
his music forces on his hearers the sensations which streamed through
his mind, then he reaches his goal. The speech of tones has then
approached the language of words, but it is far more capable of expression
and declaration.&rsquo; And Mahler raised his glass and emptied it with
&lsquo;<i>Pereat den Programmen!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Mahler&rsquo;s enthusiastic admirer and partisan, Ernst Otto
Nodnagel, of Darmstadt, contributed to &ldquo;Die Musik&rdquo; (second November
number and first December number of 1904) a technical analysis
of the Fifth symphony, an analysis of twenty-three large octavo pages,
with a beautiful motto from Schiller. This analysis, published by Peters,
and sold for the sum of thirty pfennig, is within reach of the humblest.</p>
<p>The symphony was completed in the spring of 1903. It was written in
1901-02 at his little country house near Maiernigg on Lake W&ouml;rther.
Other works of this date are the <i>Kindertotenlieder</i> and other songs
with R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s verses. The symphony is scored for four flutes (and
piccolo), three oboes, three clarinets (and bass clarinet), two bassoons,
one double bassoon, six horns (in third movement a horn obbligato),
four trumpets, three trombones, tuba, kettledrums, snare drum, bass
drum, cymbals, triangle, Glockenspiel, gong, harp, and strings.</p>
<p>Let us respect the wishes of the composer who looked on analytical
or explanatory programmes as the abomination of desolation. Yet it
may be said that in the <i>rondo finale</i>, after the second chief motive
enters as the subject of a fugal section, one of the lesser themes used
in the development is derived from Mahler&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Lob des hohen
Verstands&rdquo; (relating to the trial of skill between the nightingale and
the cuckoo with the ass as judge).</p>

<p class="center">(Born at Hamburg, February 3, 1809; died at Leipsic, November 4, 1847)</p>
<p>Mendelssohn in his maturity wrote his music as he looks in his
picture, smiling and with a stickpin in his ruffled shirt. When at
seventeen he wrote his overture to <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>,
he was a romanticist. What might he not have accomplished if he
had been poor and less respectable! He wrote this overture before
he had been spoiled by flattery; before he became a composer of
priggish formulas. Aubrey Beardsley pictured the later Mendelssohn
in that forgotten magazine, the <i>Savoy</i>. There you see the man
that was shocked by the resurrection of the nuns in <i>Robert the
Devil</i>, by Terlina undressing in <i>Fra Diavolo</i>, by Hugo&rsquo;s <i>Ruy Blas</i>,
although he condescended to write an overture for it. The spotless
Mendelssohn who delighted Queen Victoria and her spouse by
playing the organ to them. But the overture to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
comedy is from another Mendelssohn, the composer of <i>The Hebrides</i>,
portions of the <i>Walpurgis Night</i>, not the man of the
oratorios and the sentimental <i>Songs without Words</i>.</p>
<h2 id="c85"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY IN A MAJOR, &ldquo;ITALIAN,&rdquo; OP. 90</span></h2>

<p>How much of Italy is there in this symphony of Mendelssohn?
Suppose there were no title. The last movement might easily be
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
recognized as a <i>saltarello</i>; but how about the other movements?
The first is light and gay, but there is no geographical or national
mood at once established, there is no authoritative characterization.
I doubt whether even a tambourine would be of material assistance.
It was not necessary for the composer to go to Naples to
write the <i>andante</i>. As for the <i>scherzo</i>, the horns with their pleasant
sentimentalism might represent today Germans in Rome,
armed with red guide books, and now and then bursting out in
songs of the Fatherland, something about the forest, or spring, or
the blissfulness of sorrow and longing. The <i>saltarello</i> part was done
much better by Berlioz. Compare this symphony, so far as local
color is concerned, with a page of Bizet painting in tones a
Southern scene, or with Richard Strauss&rsquo; Italian suite, or with the
suite of Charpentier, and Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music seems without
marked distinction, rather tame and drab. Yet the first movement
and the <i>finale</i> are amiable music, pages that may awaken a gentlemanlike
joy, and there is no denying the clearness of the musical
thought, the purity of expression, the sure and polished workmanship.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The symphony was completed in Berlin. Mendelssohn wrote to
Pastor Bauer, &ldquo;My work about which I recently had many misgivings
is completed, and, looking it over, I now find that, contrary to my
expectations, it satisfies me. I believe it has become a good piece. Be
that as it may, I feel it shows progress, and that is the main point.&rdquo;
The score bears the date, Berlin, March 13, 1833.</p>
<p>The first performance from manuscript and under the direction of
the composer was at the sixth concert of the Philharmonic Society that
season, May 13, 1833. &ldquo;The concerts of the Society were this year, and
onward, given in the Hanover Square Rooms, which had just been remodeled.
The symphony made a great impression, and Felix electrified
the audience by his wonderful performance of Mozart&rsquo;s Concerto
in D minor, his <i>cadenzas</i> being marvels in design and execution. His
new overture in C was produced at the last concert of the season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Mendelssohn began to revise the symphony in June, 1834. On
February 16, 1835, he wrote to Klingemann that he was biting his
nails over the first movement and could not yet master it, but that
in any event it should be something different&mdash;perhaps wholly new&mdash;and
he had this doubt about every one of the movements. Towards the
end of 1837 the revision was completed. Whether the symphony in its
new form was played at a Philharmonic Society Concert in London,
June 18, 1838, conducted by Moscheles, is doubtful, although Moscheles
asked him for it. The first performance of the revised version on the
European continent was at a Gewandhaus concert, Leipsic, November 1,
1849, when Julius Rietz conducted. The score and orchestral parts
were not published until March, 1851.</p>
<p>Grove remarked of this work: &ldquo;The music itself is better than any
commentary. Let that be marked, learned, and inwardly digested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reismann found the first movement, <i>allegro vivace</i>, A major, 6-8, to
be a paraphrase of the so-called &ldquo;Hunting Song&rdquo; in the first group of
<i>Songs without Words</i>. The tonality is the same, and this is often enough
to fire the imagination of a commentator. The chief subject begins
with the violins in the second measure and is developed at length. The
second subject, E major, is for clarinets. The development section begins
with a new figure treated in imitation by the strings. The chief
theme is then used, with the second introduced contrapuntally. In
the recapitulation section the second theme is given to the strings.</p>
<p>The second movement, <i>andante con moto</i>, D minor, 4-4, sometimes
called the &ldquo;Pilgrims&rsquo; March,&rdquo; but without any authority, is said &ldquo;to
have been a processional hymn, which probably gave the name of
&lsquo;&ldquo;<i>Italian</i>&rdquo; symphony&rsquo; to the whole (!).&rdquo; Lampadius remarks in connection
with this: &ldquo;I cannot discover that the piece bears any mark of
a decided Catholic character, for, if I recollect rightly, I once heard
Moscheles say that Mendelssohn had in his mind as the source of this
second movement an old Bohemian folk song.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> The two introductory
measures suggested to Grove &ldquo;the cry of a muezzin from his
minaret,&rdquo; but, pray, what has this to do with Italy? The chief theme
is given out by oboe, clarinet, and violas. The violins take it up with
counterpoint for the flutes. There is a new musical idea for the clarinets.
The first theme returns. The two introductory measures are used with
this material in the remainder of the movement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>The third movement is marked simply &ldquo;<i>con moto moderato</i>&rdquo; (A
major, 3-4). &ldquo;There is a tradition (said to originate with Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
brother-in-law, Hensel, but still of uncertain authority) that
it was transferred to its present place from some earlier composition.
It is not, however, to be found in either of the twelve unpublished
juvenile symphonies; and in the first rough draft of this symphony
there is no sign of its having been interpolated. In style the movement
is, no doubt, earlier than the rest of the work.&rdquo; The movement opens
with a theme for first violins; the trio with a passage for bassoons
and horns. The third part is a repetition of the first. In the <i>coda</i> there
is at the end a suggestion of the trio.</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i> is a <i>saltarello, presto</i>, 4-4. There are three themes. The
flutes, after six introductory measures, play the first. In the second,
somewhat similar in character, the first and second violins answer each
other. The third is also given to the first and second violins alternately,
but now in the form of a continuously moving, not a jumping figure.</p>
<p>This <i>saltarello</i> was undoubtedly inspired by the Carnival at Rome,
of which Mendelssohn gave a description in his letter of February 8,
1831. &ldquo;On Saturday all the world went to the Capitol, to witness the
form of the Jews&rsquo; supplications to be suffered to remain in the Sacred
City for another year, a request which is refused at the foot of the
hill, but, after repeated entreaties, granted on the summit, and the
Ghetto is assigned to them. It was a tiresome affair; we waited two
hours, and after all, understood the oration of the Jews as little as the
answer of the Christians. I came down again in very bad humor, and
thought that the Carnival had begun rather unpropitiously. So I
arrived in the Corso and was driving along, thinking no evil, when I
was suddenly assailed by a shower of sugar comfits. I looked up; they
had been flung by some young ladies whom I had seen occasionally
at balls, but scarcely knew, and when in my embarrassment I took
off my hat to bow to them, the pelting began in right earnest. Their
carriage drove on, and in the next was Miss T&mdash;&mdash;, a delicate young
Englishwoman. I tried to bow to her, but she pelted me, too; so I
became quite desperate, and clutching the confetti, I flung them back
bravely. There were swarms of my acquaintances and my blue coat was
soon as white as that of a miller. The B&mdash;&mdash;s were standing on a
balcony, flinging confetti like hail at my head; and thus pelting and
pelted, amid a thousand jests and jeers and the most extravagant
masks, the day ended with races.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>It is a singular reflection on &ldquo;local color&rdquo; in music that Schumann
mistook the &ldquo;<i>Scotch</i>&rdquo; symphony for the &ldquo;<i>Italian</i>&rdquo; and wrote of the
former: &ldquo;It can, like the Italian scenes in <i>Titan</i>, cause you for a
moment to forget the sorrow of not having seen that heavenly country.&rdquo;
The best explanation of this Symphony No. 4, if there be need of any
explanation, is found in the letters of Mendelssohn from Italy.</p>
<h2 id="c86"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE AND INCIDENTAL MUSIC TO SHAKESPEARE&rsquo;S LAY, &ldquo;A MIDSUMMER NIGHT&rsquo;S DREAM&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Translations by Schlegel and Tieck of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were read
by Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny in 1826. The overture, <i>A Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, was written in July and August of that year.</p>
<p>Klingemann tells us that part of the score was written &ldquo;in the summer,
in the open air, in the Mendelssohns&rsquo; garden at Berlin, for I was
present.&rdquo; This garden belonged to a house in the Leipziger Strasse
(No. 3). It was near the Potsdam gate, and when Abraham Mendelssohn,
the father, bought it, his friends complained that he was
moving out of the world. There was an estate of about ten acres. In
the house was a room for theatrical performances; and the center
of the garden house formed a hall which held several hundred, and it
was here that Sunday music was performed. In the time of Frederick
the Great this garden was part of the Thiergarten. In the summer-houses
were writing materials, and Felix edited a newspaper, called
in summer <i>The Garden Times</i>, and in the winter <i>The Snow and Tea
Times</i>.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn told Hiller that he had worked long and eagerly on the
overture: &ldquo;How in his spare time between the lectures at the Berlin
University he had gone on extemporizing at it on the piano of a beautiful
woman who lived close by; &lsquo;for a whole year, I hardly did anything
else,&rsquo; he said; and certainly he had not wasted his time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that Mendelssohn made two drafts of the overture, and
discarded the earlier after he completed the first half. This earlier draft
began with the four chords and the fairy figure; then followed a regular
overture, in which use was made of a theme typical of the loves of
Lysander and Hermia, and of kin to the &ldquo;love melody&rdquo; of the present
version.</p>
<p>The overture was first written as a pianoforte duet, and it was first
played to Moscheles in that form by the composer and his sister,
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
November 19, 1826. It was performed afterwards by an orchestra in
the garden house. The first public performance was at Stettin in
February, 1827, from manuscript, when Karl L&ouml;we conducted. The
critic was not hurried in those days, for an account of the concert
appeared in the <i>Harmonicon</i> for December of that year. The critic had
had time to think the matter over, and his conclusion was that the
overture was of little importance.</p>
<p>The overture was performed in England for the first time on
June 24 (Midsummer Day), 1829, at a concert given by Louis Drouet
in the Argyll Rooms. Sir George Smart, who returned from the concert
with Mendelssohn, left the score of the overture in a hackney coach.
So the story is told; but is it not possible that the blameless Mendelssohn
left it? The score was never found, and Mendelssohn rewrote it. The
overture was played in England for the first time in connection with
Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedy at London, in 1840, when Mme Vestris appeared
in the performance at Covent Garden.</p>
<p>The orchestral parts were published in 1832; the score in April, 1835.
The overture is dedicated to His Royal Majesty the Crown Prince of
Prussia.</p>
<p>The overture opens <i>allegro di molto</i>, E major, 2-2, with four prolonged
chords in the wood-wind. On the last of these follows immediately
a <i>pianissimo</i> chord of E minor in violins and violas. This is
followed by the &ldquo;fairy music&rdquo; in E minor, given out and developed
by divided violins with some <i>pizzicati</i> in the violas. A subsidiary
theme is given out <i>fortissimo</i> by full orchestra. The melodious second
theme, in B major, begun by the wood-wind, is then continued by the
strings and fuller and fuller orchestra. Several picturesque features are
then introduced: the Bergomask dance from the fifth act of the play; a
curious imitation of the bray of an ass in allusion to Bottom, who is,
according to Maginn&rsquo;s paradox, &ldquo;the blockhead, <i>the</i> lucky man on
whom Fortune showers her favors beyond measure&rdquo;; and the quickly
descending scale passage for violoncellos, which was suggested to the
composer by the buzzing of a big fly in the Schoenhauser Garten. The
free fantasia is wholly on the first theme. The third part of the overture
is regular, and there is a short <i>coda</i>. The overture ends with the
four sustained chords with which it opened.</p>
<p class="tb">In 1843 King Frederick William the Fourth of Prussia wished
Mendelssohn to compose music for the plays <i>Antigone</i>, <i>A Midsummer</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
<i>Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, <i>Athalie</i>, which should be produced in September.
During March and April of that year Mendelssohn, who had written
the overture in 1826, composed the additional music for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
play. Tieck had divided the play into three acts and had said nothing
to the composer about the change. Mendelssohn had composed with
reference to the original division. The first performance was in the
Royal Theater in the New Palace, Potsdam, October 14, 1843, on the
eve of the festival of the King&rsquo;s birthday. Mendelssohn conducted.</p>
<p>The score was published in June, 1848; the orchestral parts in August
of that year. The first edition for pianoforte was published in September,
1844.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music to the play consists of thirteen numbers:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt><span class="cn">I. </span>Overture;</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">II. </span><i>Scherzo</i> (Entr&rsquo;acte after Act I);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">III. </span>Fairy March (in Act II);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">IV. </span>&ldquo;You spotted snakes,&rdquo; for two sopranos and chorus (in Act II);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">V. </span>Melodrama (in Act II);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">VI. </span>Intermezzo (Entr&rsquo;acte after Act II);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">VII. </span>Melodrama (in Act III);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">VIII. </span>Notturno (Entr&rsquo;acte after Act III);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">IX. </span><i>Andante</i> (in Act IV);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">X. </span>Wedding March (after the close of Act IV);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">XI. </span><i>Allegro commodo</i> and <i>Marcia funebre</i> (in Act V);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">XII. </span>Bergomask Dance (in Act V);</dt>
<dt><span class="cn">XIII. </span><i>Finale</i> to Act V.</dt></dl>
<p>Many of the themes in these numbers were taken from the overture.</p>
<p>The <i>scherzo</i> (entr&rsquo;acte between Acts I and II) is an <i>allegro vivace</i>
in G minor, 3-8. &ldquo;Presumably Mendelssohn intended it as a purely
musical reflection of the scene in Quince&rsquo;s house&mdash;the first meeting to
discuss the play to be given by the workmen at the wedding&mdash;with
which the first act ends. Indeed, there is a passing allusion to Nick
Bottom&rsquo;s bray in it. But the general character of the music is bright
and fairy-like, with nothing of the grotesque about it.&rdquo; The <i>scherzo</i>
presents an elaborate development of two themes that are not sharply
contrasted; the first theme has a subsidiary. The score is dedicated to
Heinrich Conrad Schleinitz.</p>
<h2 id="c87"><span class="h2line1">CONCERT OVERTURE, &ldquo;THE HEBRIDES,&rdquo; OR &ldquo;FINGAL&rsquo;S CAVE,&rdquo; OP. 26</span></h2>
<p>In the <i>Hebrides</i> overture, Mendelssohn shook off his priggish
formalism. He had been deeply affected by the sight of Staffa and
Fingal&rsquo;s Cave; he was not ashamed to translate his emotions into
music without obsequious obedience to the old pedagogic traditions.
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
Here he is poetic, picturing the wildness of the far-off scene
without too deliberate attempt at realism. Here is the suggestion&mdash;and
with the small orchestra of the period!&mdash;as Mr. Apthorp put
it, of screaming sea birds, whistling winds, the salty smell of the
seaweed on the rocks. For once Mendelssohn showed himself more
than a careful manufacturer of music when he revised his score,
saying that the middle section smelt more of counterpoint than
of train oil, sea gulls, and salt fish.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Mendelssohn saw Staffa and Fingal&rsquo;s Cave on August 7, 1829. He
at once determined to picture the scenes in music. He wrote to his
sister on that day: &ldquo;That you may understand how extraordinarily
the Hebrides affected me, the following came into my mind&rdquo;; and he
then noted down twenty-one measures in <i>alla breve</i>, which coincide
for the first ten and a half measures with the later measures in 4-4.
Ferdinand Hiller, who lived with Mendelssohn in Paris during the
winter of 1831-32, tells how Mendelssohn brought to him the sketched
score. &ldquo;He told me how the thing came to him in its full form and
color when he saw Fingal&rsquo;s Cave; he also informed me how the first
measures, which contain the chief theme, had come into his mind.
In the evening he was making a visit with his friend Klingemann on
a Scottish family. There was a pianoforte in the room; but it was
Sunday, and there was no possibility of music. He employed all his
diplomacy to get at the pianoforte for a moment; when he had succeeded,
he dashed off the theme out of which the great work grew.
It was finished at D&uuml;sseldorf, but only after an interval of years.&rdquo;
Hiller was mistaken about the place and time of completion.</p>
<p>The overture was first performed on May 14, 1832, from manuscript,
in London, at the sixth concert of the Philharmonic Society at
Covent Garden. Thomas Attwood conducted. The composer wrote:
&ldquo;It went splendidly, and sounded so droll amongst all the Rossini
things.&rdquo; The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> said that the overture as descriptive music
was a failure. George Hogarth wrote in his History of the Philharmonic
Society (1862): &ldquo;It at once created a great sensation&mdash;a sensation, we
need scarcely add, that has not been diminished by numberless repetitions.
At a general meeting of the Society on the 7th of June, 1832,
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
Sir George Smart read a letter from Mendelssohn requesting the
Society&rsquo;s acceptance of the score of this overture; and it was resolved
to present him with a piece of plate in token of the Society&rsquo;s thanks,
which was forthwith done.&rdquo; The <i>Harmonicon</i> praised the overture
highly, and found the key of B minor well suited to the purpose.</p>
<h2 id="c88"><span class="h2line1">CONCERTO FOR VIOLIN, IN E MINOR, OP. 64</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>Allegro molto appassionato</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Andante</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Allegretto non troppo; allegro molto vivace</dd></dl>
<p>The concerto does not call for any true depth of emotional display.
The sentiment is amiable and genteel, with a dash of becoming
melancholy, and the strength is the conventional strength of a
man who in music had little virility. Beautifully made, a polished
piece of mechanism, the concerto always, under favorable circumstances,
interests and promotes contagious good feeling.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Mendelssohn in his youth composed a violin concerto with accompaniment
of stringed instruments, also a concerto for violin and pianoforte
(1823) with the same sort of accompaniment. These works were
left in manuscript. It was at the time that he was put into jackets and
trousers. Probably these works were played at the musical parties at
the Mendelssohn house in Berlin on alternate Sunday mornings. Mendelssohn
took violin lessons first with Carl Wilhelm Henning and
afterwards with Eduard Rietz, for whom he wrote this early violin
concerto. When Mendelssohn played any stringed instrument, he preferred
the viola.</p>
<p>As early as 1838 Mendelssohn conceived the plan of composing a
violin concerto in the manner of the one in E minor, for on July 30
he wrote to Ferdinand David: &ldquo;I should like to write a violin concerto
for you next winter. One in E minor is running in my head, and the
beginning does not leave me in peace.&rdquo; On July 24 of the next year he
wrote from Hochheim to David, who had pressed him to compose
the concerto: &ldquo;It is nice of you to urge me for a violin concerto! I
have the liveliest desire to write one for you, and if I have a few
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
propitious days here, I&rsquo;ll bring you something. But the task is not an
easy one. You demand that it should be brilliant, and how is such a
one as I to do this? The whole of the first solo is to be for the
E string!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concerto was composed in 1844 and completed on September 16
of that year at Bad Soden, near Frankfort-on-the-Main. David received
the manuscript in November. Many letters passed between the composer
and the violinist. David gave advice freely. Mendelssohn took
time in revising and polishing. Even after the score was sent to the
publishers in December, there were more changes. David is largely
responsible for the <i>cadenza</i> as it now stands.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn played parts of the concerto on the pianoforte to his
friends; the whole of it to Moscheles at Bad Soden.</p>
<p>The first performance was from manuscript at the twentieth
Gewandhaus concert in Leipsic, March 13, 1845. Ferdinand David was
the violinist. Niels W. Gade conducted.</p>
<p>The concerto is in three connected movements. The first, <i>allegro
molto appassionato</i>, E minor, 2-2, begins immediately after an introductory
measure with the first theme given out by the solo violin.
This theme is developed at length by the solo instrument, which then
goes on with <i>cadenza</i>-like passage-work, after which the theme is repeated
and developed as a <i>tutti</i> by the full orchestra. The second theme
is first given out <i>pianissimo</i> in harmony by clarinets and flutes over a
sustained organ-point in the solo instrument. The chief theme is used
in the development which begins in the solo violin. The brilliant solo
<i>cadenza</i> ends with a series of <i>arpeggios</i>, which continue on through
the whole announcement of the first theme by orchestral strings and
wind. The conclusion section is in regular form. There is no pause
between this movement and the <i>andante</i>.</p>
<p>The first section of the <i>andante</i>, C major, is a development of the
first theme sung by the solo violin. The middle part is taken up with
the development of the second theme, a somewhat agitated melody.
The third part is a repetition of the first, with the melody in the solo
violin, but with a different accompaniment. Mendelssohn originally
intended the accompaniment (strings) to the first theme to be played
<i>pizzicato</i>. He wrote to David, &ldquo;I intended to write in this way, but
something or other&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;prevented me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i> opens with a short introduction, <i>allegretto non troppo</i>,
E minor, 4-4. The main body of the <i>finale, allegro molto vivace</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
E major, 4-4, begins with calls on horns, trumpets, bassoons, drums,
answered by <i>arpeggios</i> of the solo violin and tremolos in the strings.
The chief theme of the <i>rondo</i> is announced by the solo instruments.
The orchestra has a second theme, B major; the violin one in G major.
In the recapitulation section the <i>fortissimo</i> second theme appears
again, this time in E major. There is a brilliant <i>coda</i>.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">MOUSSORGSKY</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Karevo, district of Toropeta, in the government of Pskov, on March 28, 1835; died at St. Petersburg on March 28, 1881)</p>
<h2 id="c90"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;A NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN&rdquo; (&ldquo;UNE NUIT SUR LE MONT-CHAUVE&rdquo;); FANTASY FOR ORCHESTRA<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Posthumous Work Completed and Orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov</span></span></span></h2>
<p>Moussorgsky&rsquo;s fantasy was composed in 1867 and was thus one
of the few early Russian orchestral compositions of a fantastically
picturesque nature. In the original form it was no doubt crude, for
Moussorgsky had little technic for the larger forms of music; he
despised &ldquo;style,&rdquo; and believed that much knowledge would prevent
him from attaining the realism that was his goal. That he himself
was not satisfied with this symphonic poem is shown by the fact
that he revised it two or three times. He died; Rimsky-Korsakov
edited it and orchestrated it. The music was finally heard after
Moussorgsky&rsquo;s death. Rimsky-Korsakov was a fastidious musician,
a learned harmonist, a master of orchestrations. It is said that he
sandpapered and polished <i>Boris Godounov</i> to the great detriment
of Moussorgsky&rsquo;s opera; he chastened the wild spirit; he tamed
the native savageness, so it is said. What did he do to this musical
picture of a Witches&rsquo; Sabbath on Bald Mountain?</p>
<p>Having heard several musical descriptions of these unholy Sabbaths,
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
where reverence was paid Satan, exultantly ruling in the
form of a he-goat, where there was horrid, obscene revelry, if we
may believe well-instructed ancient and modern writers on Satanism
and witchcraft, we wonder why any woman, young or old,
straddled a broomstick and made her way hopefully and joyfully
to a lonely mountain or barren plain. If we can put faith in the
musical descriptions given by Berlioz, Bo&iuml;to, Gounod, Satan&rsquo;s evening
receptions were comparatively tame affairs, with dancing of a
nature that would not have offended the selectmen and their wives
and sisters of our little village in the sixties, when the waltz was
frowned on as a sensual and ungodly diversion. Liszt&rsquo;s <i>Mephisto
Waltz</i> is, indeed, sensuous, fleshly, but Satan in this instance only
plays the fiddle; he is not master of sabbatic revels. In Moussorgsky&rsquo;s
symphonic poem the <i>allegro</i> devoted to the worshipers of the
devil is rather commonplace; its laborious wildness becomes
monotonous in spite of the editor&rsquo;s instrumentation. Far more
original and effective is the second section, in which a church bell
puts the blasphemous revelers to flight.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>In September, 1860, Moussorgsky wrote to Balakirev: &ldquo;I have also
been given a most interesting piece of work to do, which must be
ready by next summer: a whole act of <i>The Bald Mountain</i> (after
Megden&rsquo;s drama <i>The Witch</i>). The assembly of the witches, various
episodes of witchcraft, the pageant of all the sorcerers, and a <i>finale</i>, the
witch dance and homage to Satan. The libretto is very fine. I have
already a few materials for the music, and it may be possible to turn
out something very good.&rdquo; In September, 1862, he wrote to Balakirev,
saying that his friend&rsquo;s attitude towards <i>The Witches</i> [<i>sic</i>] had embittered
him. &ldquo;I considered, still consider, and shall consider forever
that the thing is satisfactory.... I come forth with a first big work.... I
shall alter neither plan nor working-out; for both are in close
relationship with the contents of the scene, and are carried out in a
spirit of genuineness, without tricks or make-believes.... I have
fulfilled my task as best I could. The one thing I shall alter is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
percussion, which I have misused.&rdquo; A letter to Rimsky-Korsakov dated
July, 1867, shows that he did rewrite <i>A Night on Bald Mountain</i>,
but remained unwilling to make further alterations.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1871-72 the director of the opera at St. Petersburg
planned that Moussorgsky, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Cui
should each write a portion of a fairy opera, <i>Mlada</i>. Moussorgsky was
to write music for some folk scenes, a march for the procession of
Slav princes and a great fantastical scene, &ldquo;The Sacrifice to the Black
Goat on Bald Mountain.&rdquo; This would give him the opportunity of
using his symphonic poem. The project fell through on account of
pecuniary reasons. Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <i>Mlada</i> was produced at St.
Petersburg in 1892.</p>
<p>In 1877 Moussorgsky undertook to write an opera <i>The Fair at
Sorotchinsi</i>, based on a tale by Gogol. He purposed to introduce in it
<i>A Night on Bald Mountain</i>, and he revised the score.</p>
<p>It is said that the original version of the symphonic poem was for
pianoforte and orchestra; that the revision for <i>Mlada</i> was for orchestra
and chorus; that the work was to serve as a scenic interlude in the
unfinished opera, <i>The Fair at Sorotchinsi</i>.</p>
<p>Rimsky-Korsakov as Moussorgsky&rsquo;s musical executor revised the
score of the poem. He retained the composer&rsquo;s argument:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subterranean din of supernatural voices. Appearance of Spirits of
Darkness, followed by that of the god Tchernobog. Glorification of
Tchernobog. Black mass. Witches&rsquo; Sabbath. At the height of the
Sabbath there sounds far off the bell of the little church in a village
which scatters the Spirits of Darkness. Daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The form is simple: a symphonic <i>allegro</i> is joined to a short <i>andante</i>;
<i>allegro feroce</i>; <i>poco meno mosso</i>.</p>
<p><i>A Night on Bald Mountain</i>, dedicated to Vladimir Stassov, is
scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons,
four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums,
bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, bell in D, and strings.</p>
<p>The first performance was at a concert of the Russian Symphony
Society at St. Petersburg on October 27, 1886. Rimsky-Korsakov conducted.
The piece met with such success that it was played later in that
season.</p>

<h2 id="c91"><span class="h2line1">WOLFGANG AMADEUS</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MOZART</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Salzburg, January 27, 1756; died at Vienna, December 5, 1791)</p>
<p>In this life that is &ldquo;so daily,&rdquo; as Jules Laforgue complained, a life
of tomorrow rather than of today, we are inclined to patronize the
ancient worthies who in their own period were very modern, or
to speak jauntily of them as bores, with their works of &ldquo;only historical
interest.&rdquo; Mozart has not escaped. Many concertgoers yawn
at his name and wonder why such men as Richard Strauss or Vincent
d&rsquo;Indy could praise him with glowing cheeks. They suspect
this attribute of worship to be a pose. Remind them of the fact that
to such widely different characters as Rossini, Chopin, Tchaikovsky,
Brahms, the musician of musicians was Mozart, and they say
lightly, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes; surely you do not pretend
to maintain that Mozart is a man of this generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, Mozart was neither a symbolist nor a pessimist. He was not
a translator of literature, sculpture, or painting into music His
imagination was not fired by a metaphysical treatise. He simply
wrote music that came into his head and disquieted him until it
was jotted down on paper. He did not go about nervously seeking
for ideas. His music is never the passionate cry, never the wild
shriek of a racked soul. His music is never hysterical, it is never
morbid. It is seldom emotional as we necessarily and unhappily
understand that word today. Perhaps for these reasons it is still
modern, immortal, and not merely on account of the long and exquisite
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
melodic line, fitting, inevitable background, delicate coloring.
Music that is only the true voice of a particular generation is
moribund as soon as it is born.</p>
<p>His music, whether it vitalizes stage characters or is absolute, as
in the three famous symphonies, and in the chamber works, is as
the music on Prospero&rsquo;s isle: &ldquo;Sounds and sweet airs that give
delight and hurt not.&rdquo; The analyst may find pleasure in praising
the unsurpassable workmanship, which is akin to the spontaneity
of natural phenomena; he may marvel at the simplicity of plan and
expression; the simplicity that is the despair of interpreters, for it
is the touchstone of their own art or artificiality&mdash;and Mozart himself,
when he told his emperor that his opera had just the right
number of notes, anticipated the judgment of time&mdash;but he is still
far from explaining the peculiar and ineffable tenderness of this
music that soothes and caresses and comforts.</p>
<p>The serenity, the classic suggestion of emotion without the distortion
that accompanies passion, would grace a tragedy of Sophocles
or a comedy by Congreve. Mozart&rsquo;s music is essentially
Grecian, yet now and then it reminds one of Watteau.</p>
<p>Hazlitt said of art that it should seem to come from the air and
return to it. But he characterized it with finer appreciation when
he said, without mention of Mozart&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;Music is color without
form; a soul without a body; a mistress whose face is veiled;
an invisible goddess.&rdquo; And for this reason Debussy is the spiritual
brother of Mozart, moderns both, yet classics.</p>

<p>Mozart wrote his symphony when in a condition of distress, but
who would know from the music of the composer&rsquo;s poverty and
gloom? The iteration of the chief theme of the second movement
soon frets the nerves, not from any poignancy of emotion, but
from its very placidity. And how seldom in Mozart&rsquo;s music is there
any emotional burst as we understand emotion today! There are
a few passages in the first movement of the G minor symphony,
pages in certain chamber works, and in the <i>Requiem</i>, and there
are the two great scenes in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, the trio between the
Don, the Commander, and Leporello after the duel, and the scene
between the blaspheming rake and the Stone Man. As a rule the
emotion of Mozart is that of the classic frieze or urn. Beauty with
him is calm and serene, and emotion, he believed, should always
be beautiful.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The symphony in E flat induced A. Apel to attempt a translation
of the music into poetry that should express the character of each
movement. It excited the fantastical E. T. A. Hoffmann to an extraordinary
rhapsody: &ldquo;Love and melancholy are breathed forth in purest
spirit tones; we feel ourselves drawn with inexpressible longing toward
the forms which beckon us to join them in their move with the spheres
in the eternal circles of the solemn dance.&rdquo; So explained Johannes
Kreisler in the <i>Phantasiest&uuml;cke in Callots Manier</i>.</p>

<p>It seems as if Mozart lost his classic serenity whenever he chose
the key of G minor. In the immortal symphony there is, except in
the beautiful, characteristically Mozartian <i>andante</i>, a feverishness,
an intensity not to be found in his other symphonies; and so in the
perfect flower of his chamber music there is a direct, passionate
appeal of one theme (G minor again) that reminds one of the
terribly earnest Verdi of the &rsquo;fifties.</p>
<p class="tb">Some years ago, a prominent writer about music, a wild-eyed
worshiper of Liszt and Wagner, published the statement that this
symphony is interesting only in a historical sense. His idols would
have been the first to laugh at him. There are few things in art
that are perfect. The G minor symphony is one of them. Its
apparent simplicity is an adorable triumph of supreme art.</p>
<h2 id="c94"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY IN C MAJOR, &ldquo;JUPITER&rdquo; (KOECHEL NO. 551)</span></h2>

<p>Hearing the <i>andante</i>, the <i>minuet</i>, and the wonderful <i>finale</i>, one
no longer questions the famous and subtle saying of Rossini. When
asked who was the greatest composer, he answered &ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo;;
he then said, &ldquo;But Mozart is the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Let the first movement pass with its second theme that reminds
one of charming music in <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>. The <i>andante</i>
could have been written only by Mozart. There is spiritualized
sensuousness; there is perfect form, exquisite proportion, and
euphony.</p>
<p>Has there not too much been said about the marvelous display
of science in the construction of the <i>finale</i>? The wonder of it is
that the display does not impress the hearer unduly. To him it is
merely gay and charming music. It ravishes his ear without his taking
interest in the technical devices, even if he could recognize and
understand them. If the title should be &ldquo;Symphony in C major
with the Fugue,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;fugue&rdquo; would not fill his soul with
dismal foreboding. There has been only one Mozart, as there has
been only one Handel.</p>
<p>It is not known who gave the title &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; to the symphony.
There is nothing in the music that reminds one of Jupiter Tonans,
Jupiter Fulgurator, Jupiter Pluvius; or of the god who, assuming
various disguises, came down to earth, where by his adventures
with women semi-divine or mortals of common clay he excited the
jealous rage of Juno. The music is not of an Olympian mood. It
is intensely human in its loveliness and its gayety.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>It is possible that the &ldquo;<i>Jupiter</i>&rdquo; symphony was performed at the
concert given by Mozart in Leipsic. The two that preceded the great
three were composed in 1783 and 1786. The latter of the two (D major)
was performed at Prague with extraordinary success. Publishers were
not slow in publishing Mozart&rsquo;s compositions, even if they were as
conspicuous niggards as Joseph II himself. The two symphonies played
at Leipsic were probably of the three composed in 1788, but this is
only a conjecture.</p>
<p>Some say the title &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; was applied to the symphony by J. B.
Cramer, to express his admiration for the loftiness of ideas and nobility
of treatment. Some maintain that the triplets in the first measure suggest
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
the thunderbolts of Jove. Some think that the &ldquo;calm, godlike
beauty&rdquo; of the music compelled the title. Others are satisfied with the
belief that the title was given to the symphony as it might be to any
masterpiece or any impressively beautiful or strong or big thing. To
them &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; expresses the power and brilliance of the work.</p>
<p>The eulogies pronounced on this symphony are familiar to all&mdash;from
Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;There are things in the world about which nothing
can be said, as Mozart&rsquo;s C major symphony with the fugue, much of
Shakespeare, and pages of Beethoven,&rdquo; to B&uuml;low&rsquo;s &ldquo;I call Brahms&rsquo;
First symphony the Tenth, not because it should be placed after the
Ninth: I should put it between the Second and the <i>Eroica</i>, just as I
think the first not the symphony of Beethoven but the one composed
by Mozart and known by the name of &lsquo;Jupiter.&rsquo;&rdquo; But there were
decriers early in the nineteenth century. Thus Hans Georg N&auml;geli
(1773-1836) attacked this symphony bitterly on account of its well-defined
and long-lined melody, &ldquo;which Mozart mingled and confounded
with a free instrumental play of ideas, and his very wealth of
fancy and emotional gifts led to a sort of fermentation in the whole
province of art, and caused it to retrograde rather than to advance.&rdquo;
He found fault with certain harmonic progressions which he characterized
as trivial. He allowed the composer originality and a certain
power of combination, but he found him without style, often shallow
and confused. He ascribed these qualities to the personal qualities of
the man himself: &ldquo;He was too hasty, when not too frivolous, and he
wrote as he himself was.&rdquo; N&auml;geli was not the last to judge a work
according to the alleged morality or immorality of the maker.</p>
<p class="tb">Mozart wrote his three greatest symphonies in 1788. The one in
E flat is dated June 26; the one in G minor, July 25; the one in C major
with the <i>fugue-finale</i>, August 10.</p>
<p>His other works of that year are of little importance with the exception
of a piano concerto in D major which he played at the coronation
festivities of Leopold II at Frankfort in 1790. Why is this? 1787 was
the year of <i>Don Giovanni</i>; 1790, the year of <i>Cosi fan tutte</i>. Was Mozart,
as some say, exhausted by the feat of producing three symphonies
in such a short time? Or was there some reason for discouragement
and consequent idleness?</p>
<p>The Ritter Gluck, composer to the Emperor Joseph II, died November
15, 1787, and thus resigned his position with a salary of 2,000
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
florins. Mozart was appointed his successor, but the thrifty Joseph cut
down the salary to 800 florins. And Mozart at this time was sadly in
need of money, as his letters show. In a letter of June, 1788, he tells
of his new lodgings, where he could have better air, a garden, quiet.
In another, dated June 27, he says: &ldquo;I have done more work in the
ten days that I have lived here than in two months in my other lodgings,
and I should be much better here, were it not for dismal thoughts
that often come to me. I must drive them resolutely away; for I am
living comfortably, pleasantly, and cheaply.&rdquo; We know that he borrowed
from Puchberg, a merchant with whom he became acquainted
at a Masonic lodge, for the letter with Puchberg&rsquo;s memorandum of
the amount is in the collection edited by Nohl.</p>
<p>Mozart could not reasonably expect help from the Emperor. The
composer of <i>Don Giovanni</i> and the &ldquo;<i>Jupiter</i>&rdquo; symphony was unfortunate
in his emperors.</p>
<p>The Emperor Joseph was in the habit of getting up at five o&rsquo;clock; he
dined on boiled bacon at 3.15 <span class="small">P.M.</span>; he preferred water as a beverage,
but would drink a glass of Tokay; he was continually putting chocolate
drops from his waistcoat pocket into his mouth; he gave gold coins
to the poor; he was unwilling to sit for his portrait; he had remarkably
fine teeth; he disliked sycophantic fuss; he patronized the English, who
introduced horse-racing; and Michael Kelly, who tells us many things,
says that Joseph was &ldquo;passionately fond of music and a most excellent
and accurate judge of it.&rdquo; We know that he did not like the music of
Mozart.</p>
<p>Joseph commanded from his composer Mozart no opera, cantata,
symphony, or piece of chamber music, although he was paying him
800 florins a year. He did order dances, for the dwellers in Vienna were
dancing mad. Kelly, who knew Mozart and sang in the first performance
of <i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i> in 1786, says in his memoirs (written by
Theodore Hook): &ldquo;The ridotto rooms, where the masquerade took
place, were in the palace; and, spacious and commodious as they were,
they were actually crammed with masqueraders. I never saw or indeed
heard of any suite of rooms where elegance and convenience were
more considered, for the propensity of the Vienna ladies for dancing
and going to carnival masquerades was so determined that nothing
was permitted to interfere with their enjoyment of their favorite
amusement.... The ladies of Vienna are particularly celebrated for
their grace and movements in waltzing, of which they never tire. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
my own part, I thought waltzing from ten at night until seven in the
morning a continual whirligig, most tiresome to the eye and ear, to
say nothing of any worse consequences.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a> Mozart wrote for these
dances, as did Haydn, Hummel, Beethoven.</p>
<p>We know little or nothing concerning the first years of the three
symphonies. Gerber&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Lexicon der Tonk&uuml;nstler</i>&rdquo; (1790) speaks appreciatively
of him: the erroneous statement is made that the Emperor
fixed his salary in 1788 at 6,000 florins; the varied ariettas for piano
are praised especially; but there is no mention whatever of any symphony.</p>
<p>The enlarged edition of Gerber&rsquo;s work (1813) contains an extended
notice of Mozart&rsquo;s last years, and we find in the summing up of his
career: &ldquo;If one knew only one of his noble symphonies, as the overpoweringly
great, fiery, perfect, pathetic, sublime symphony in C.&rdquo;
And this reference is undoubtedly to the &ldquo;<i>Jupiter</i>&rdquo; the one in C major.</p>
<p>Mozart gave a concert at Leipsic in May, 1789. The programme was
made up wholly of pieces by him, and among them were two symphonies
in manuscript. At a rehearsal for this concert Mozart took the
first <i>allegro</i> of a symphony at a very fast pace, so that the orchestra
soon was unable to keep up with him. He stopped the players and
began again at the same speed, and he stamped the time so furiously
that his steel shoe buckle flew into pieces. He laughed, and, as the
players still dragged, he began the <i>allegro</i> a third time. The musicians,
by this time exasperated, played to suit him. Mozart afterwards said
to some who wondered at his conduct, because he had on other
occasions protested against undue speed: &ldquo;It was not caprice on my
part. I saw that the majority of the players were well along in years.
They would have dragged everything beyond endurance if I had not
set fire to them and made them angry, so that out of sheer spite they
did their best.&rdquo; Later in the rehearsal he praised the orchestra, and
said that it was unnecessary for it to rehearse the accompaniment to
the pianoforte concerto: &ldquo;The parts are correct, you play well, and so
do I.&rdquo; This concert, by the way, was poorly attended, and half of those
who were present had received free tickets from Mozart, who was
generous in such matters.</p>
<p>Mozart also gave a concert of his own works at Frankfort, October
14, 1790. Symphonies were played in Vienna in 1788, but they were by
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
Haydn; and one by Mozart was played in 1791. In 1792 a symphony by
Mozart was played at Hamburg.</p>
<p>The early programmes, even when they have been preserved, seldom
determine the date of a first performance. It was the custom to print:
&ldquo;<i>Symphonie von Wranitsky</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Sinfonie von Mozart</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Sinfonia di
Haydn</i>.&rdquo; Furthermore, it should be remembered that <i>Sinfonie</i> was then
a term often applied to any work in three or more movements written
for strings, or strings and wind instruments.</p>
<h2 id="c95"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO THE OPERA, &ldquo;THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><i>Le Nozze di Figaro: dramma giocoso in quadro atti; poesia di
Lorenzo Da Ponte, aggiustata dalla commedia del Beaumarchais, &ldquo;Le
Mariage de Figaro&rdquo;; musica di W. A. Mozart</i>, was composed at Vienna
in 1786 and produced there on May 1 of the same year.</p>
<p>The overture opens (<i>presto</i>, D major, 4-4) immediately with the
first theme; the first part of it is a running passage of seven measures
in eighth notes (strings and bassoons in octaves), and the second part
is given for four measures to wind instruments, with a joyous response
of seven measures by full orchestra. This theme is repeated. A subsidiary
theme follows, and the second theme appears in A major, a
gay figure in the violins, with bassoon, afterward flute. There is no
free fantasia. There is a long <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>Mozart saw in the play of Beaumarchais an excellent libretto for an
opera. Da Ponte tells the story in his amusing <i>Memoirs</i>: &ldquo;Talking
one day with him [Mozart], he asked me if I could turn Beaumarchais&rsquo;s
<i>Noces de Figaro</i> into an opera. The proposition was to my
taste, and the success was immediate and universal. A little before,
this piece had been forbidden by the Emperor&rsquo;s command, on account
of its immorality. How then to propose it anew? Baron Vetzlar
[Wezlar] offered me with his customary generosity a reasonable price
for my libretto and assured me that he would see to its production at
London or in France, if it were refused in Vienna. I did not accept
the offer, and I secretly began work. I waited the opportune moment
to propose the poem either to the Intendant or, if I had the courage,
to the Emperor himself. Martin alone was in my confidence, and he
was so generous, out of deference to Mozart, to give me time to finish
my piece before I began work on one for him. As fast as I wrote the
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
words, Mozart wrote the music, and it was all finished in six weeks.
The lucky star of Mozart willed an opportune moment and permitted
me to carry my manuscript directly to the Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; said Joseph to me. &lsquo;You know that Mozart, remarkable
for his instrumental music, has with one exception never written
for song, and the exception is not good for much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I answered timidly, &lsquo;Without the kindness of the Emperor, I should
have written only one drama in Vienna.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True: but I have already forbidden the German company to play
this piece <i>Figaro</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know it; but, in turning it into an opera, I have cut out whole
scenes, shortened others, and been careful everywhere to omit anything
that might shock the conventionalities and good taste; in a word, I have
made a work worthy of the theater honored by His Majesty&rsquo;s protection.
As for the music, as far as I can judge, it seems to me a masterpiece.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right; I trust to your taste and prudence. Send the score to the
copyists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moment afterward I was at Mozart&rsquo;s. I had not yet told him the
good news, when he was ordered to go to the palace with his score.
He obeyed, and the Emperor thus heard several <i>morceaux</i> which delighted
him. Joseph II had a very correct taste in music, and in general
for everything that is included in the fine arts. The prodigious success
of this work throughout the whole world is a proof of it. The music,
incredible to relate, did not obtain a unanimous vote of praise. The
Viennese composers crushed by it, Rosenberg and Casti especially,
never failed to run it down.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>Did Da Ponte show himself the courtier when he spoke of the
Emperor&rsquo;s &ldquo;very correct taste in music&rdquo;?</p>
<p>There was a cabal from the start against the production of Mozart&rsquo;s
opera. Kelly says in his <i>Reminiscences</i>: &ldquo;Every one of the opera company
took part in the contest. I alone was a stickler for Mozart, and
naturally enough, for he had a claim on my warmest wishes.... Of
all the performers in this opera at that time, but one survives&mdash;myself.
[This was written in 1826.] It was allowed that never was opera
stronger cast. I have seen it performed at different periods in other
countries, and well too, but no more to compare with its original performance
than light is to darkness. All the original performers had the
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
advantage of the instruction of the composer, who transfused into their
minds his inspired meaning. I never shall forget his little animated
countenance, when lighted up with the glowing rays of genius; it is as
impossible to describe as it would be to paint sunbeams.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c96"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO THE OPERA &ldquo;THE MAGIC FLUTE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Emanuel Johann Schikaneder, the author of the libretto of <i>Die
Zauberfl&ouml;te</i> (The Magic Flute), was a wandering theater director,
poet, composer, and play actor. Vain, improvident, shrewd, a bore, he
nevertheless had good qualities that won for him the friendship of
Mozart. In 1791 Schikaneder was the director of the Auf der Wieden,
a little theater where comic operas were performed. He no doubt
would have made a success of his venture, had he curbed his ambition.
On the verge of failure, he made a fairy drama out of <i>Lulu, or the
Enchanted Flute</i>, Liebeskind&rsquo;s story in a collection of fairy tales published
by Wieland. He asked Mozart to write the music for it. Mozart,
pleased with the scenario, accepted the offer and said: &ldquo;If I do not
bring you out of your trouble, and if the work is not successful, you
must not blame me; for I have never written magic music.&rdquo; Schikaneder
had followed closely Wieland&rsquo;s text; but he learned that
Marinelli, a rival manager, the director of the Leopoldstadt Theater,
thought of putting upon the stage a piece with the same subject; so he
hurriedly, and with the assistance of an actor named Gieseke, modified
the plot, and substituted for the evil genius of the play the high priest
Sarastro, who appears to be the custodian of the secrets and the executor
of the wishes of the Masonic order.</p>
<p>Schikaneder knew the ease with which Mozart wrote. He also knew
that it was necessary to keep watch over him, that he might be ready
at the appointed time. Mozart&rsquo;s wife was then in Baden. Schikaneder
therefore put Mozart in a little pavilion which was in the midst of a
garden near his theater. The music of <i>The Magic Flute</i> was written in
this pavilion and in a room of the casino of Josephdorf. Mozart was
deep in doleful dumps when he began his task, so Schikaneder surrounded
him with members of his company. It was long believed that
the composer was then inspired by the beautiful eyes of the singing
woman, Gerl, but the story may rest on no better foundation than the
one of the Mme Hofdaemmel tragedy, which even Otto Jahn thought
worthy of his investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Schikaneder made his proposal early in March, 1791. The overture,
with the Priests&rsquo; March, was composed September 28, 1791. On September
30 of that year <i>Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</i>, a grand opera in two acts, was
produced at the Auf der Wieden Theater.</p>
<p>Schikaneder&rsquo;s name was in large type on the bill; Mozart&rsquo;s name was
in small type underneath the cast. Johann Schenk (1753-1836), who
made money and won fame by the popularity of his operas&mdash;<i>Der
Dorfbarbier</i> (1796) was long a favorite&mdash;Schenk gave Beethoven
lessons in counterpoint at Vienna in 1793-94&mdash;sat in one of the
orchestra seats. At the end of the overture, he went to Mozart and
kissed his hand. Mozart stroked his admirer&rsquo;s cheek. But the first act
was not well received. Mozart went behind the scenes and saw
Schikaneder in his costume of a bird. He reassured Mozart, but the
opera disappointed the Viennese at first, and Mozart was cut to the
quick. The cool reception was not due to the character of the subject;
for &ldquo;magic plays&rdquo; with music of Viennese composers, as Wenzel
M&uuml;ller, were very popular, and <i>The Magic Flute</i> was regarded as a
<i>Singspiel</i>, a &ldquo;magic farce,&rdquo; with unusually elaborate music. The report
from Vienna that was published in Kunzen and Reichardt&rsquo;s music
journal, <i>Studien fur Tonk&uuml;nstler und Musikfreunde</i> (Berlin, 1793,
p. 79), tells the story: &ldquo;The new machine comedy, <i>The Magic Flute</i>,
with music by our <i>Kapellmeister</i> Mozard [<i>sic</i>], which was given at
great expense and with such sumptuousness, did not meet with the
expected success, for the contents and dialogue of the piece are utterly
worthless.&rdquo; Schikaneder was obstinate in his faith; the opera soon
became the fashion. The two hundredth representation was celebrated
at Vienna in October, 1795. <i>The Magic Flute</i> made its way over the
continent. The libretto was translated into Dutch, Swedish, Danish,
Polish, Italian. Paris knew the opera in 1801 (August 23) as <i>Les
Myst&egrave;res d&rsquo;Isis</i>. The first performance in London was on May 25,
1819, in Italian.</p>
<p>Mozart died shortly after the production of <i>The Magic Flute</i>, in
deep distress. This opera, with the music of his <i>Requiem</i>, was in his
mind until the final delirium. While the opera was performing he
would take his watch from under his pillow and follow the performance
in imagination: &ldquo;We are now at the end of the act,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Now
comes the grand aria for the Queen of Night.&rdquo; The day before he
died, he sang with his weak voice the opening measures of &ldquo;Der
Vogelf&auml;nger bin ich ja,&rdquo; and endeavored to beat the time with his
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
hands. The frivolous and audacious Schikaneder, &ldquo;sensualist, parasite,
spendthrift,&rdquo; filled his purse by this opera: in 1798 he built the Theater
an der Wien. On the roof he put his own statue, clothed in the feather
costume of Papageno. His luck was not constant; in 1812 he died in
poverty.</p>

<p>Mozart composed five violin concertos at Salzburg in 1775. The
accompaniment of the five concertos is scored for the same instruments:
two oboes, two horns, strings. In 1776 Mozart wrote a sixth
concerto&mdash;E flat major&mdash;with an accompaniment scored for flute, two
oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. A seventh was discovered
by Dr. Kopfermann in 1907. There is some doubt as to its genuineness.</p>
<p>These concertos were undoubtedly written for Mozart&rsquo;s own use.
As a child, he played the violin as well as the forerunners of the pianoforte,
and on his tour in 1763 he played the violin in public. His first
published composition was a sonata in C major for pianoforte and
violin (K. No. 6). This, and one in D major, were composed in 1763
at Paris. They are dedicated to the Princess Victoire of France. In
1775 Mozart was practicing diligently the violin to please his father.
It was one of Wolfgang&rsquo;s duties at the Court to play the violin. He
disliked to do it. His father, an excellent violinist, encouraged his
son: &ldquo;You have no idea how well you play the violin; if you would
only do yourself justice, and play with boldness, spirit, and fire, you
would be the first violinist in Europe.&rdquo; This was in answer to a letter
from Munich in which Mozart had written: &ldquo;I played as though I were
the greatest fiddler in Europe.&rdquo; In 1777 the father reproached him for
neglecting the violin (in Vienna Wolfgang preferred to play the viola
in quartets). And it was in 1777 that Mozart wrote of one Franzl
whom he heard playing a violin concerto at Mannheim: &ldquo;You know
I am no great lover of difficulties. He plays difficult things, but one
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
does not recognize the difficulties and imagines that one could do the
same thing at once: that is true art. He also has a beautiful round tone&mdash;not
a note is missing, one hears everything; everything is well
marked. He has a fine <i>staccato</i> bow, up as well as down; and I have
never heard so good a double shake as his. In a word, though he is no
wizard, he is a solid violinist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The characteristics of the Salzburg violin concertos are the same.
They are in three movements, <i>allegro</i>, <i>andante</i> or <i>adagio</i>, and <i>rondo</i>.
The first movement is the one most developed, although it might be
considered as in aria form rather than the form befitting a first movement
of a symphony. There is the customary alternation between <i>tutti</i>
and solo passages. The structure is more compact than that of the
aria; it has more life. The &ldquo;passage&rdquo; measures grow out of the themes,
play about them, or are closely related to them. The second movement
requires expressive playing of sustained melody and is of a cheerful
character. The <i>finale</i> is in rondo form and joyful mood.</p>
<h2 id="c98"><span class="h2line1">MOZART AS PIANIST</span></h2>
<p>From Mozart&rsquo;s letters, one learns something about his own manner
of playing the piano:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herr Stein sees and hears that I am more of a player than Beecke&mdash;that
without making grimaces of any kind I play so expressively that,
according to his own confession, no one shows off his pianoforte as
well as I. That I always remain strictly in time surprises everyone; they
cannot understand that the left hand should not in the least be concerned
in a <i>tempo rubato</i>. When they play, the left hand always follows&rdquo;
(1777).</p>
<p>About Nannette Stein&rsquo;s playing: &ldquo;She sits opposite the treble instead
of in the middle of the instrument, so that there may be greater
opportunities for swaying about and making grimaces. Then she rolls
up her eyes and smirks. If a passage occurs twice, it is played slower
the second time; if three times, still slower. When a passage comes,
up goes the arm, and, if there is to be an emphasis it must come from
the arm, heavily and clumsily, not from the fingers. But the best of all
is that when there comes a passage (which ought to flow like oil)
in which there necessarily occurs a change of fingers, there is no need
of taking care: when the time comes you stop, lift the hand and
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
nonchalantly begin again. This helps one the better to catch a false
note, and the effect is frequently curious&rdquo; (1777). Nannette was then
eight years old.</p>
<p>At Aurnhammer&rsquo;s: &ldquo;The young woman is a fright, but she plays
ravishingly, though she lacks the true singing style in her <i>cantabile</i>; she
is too jerky&rdquo; (1781).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever I played for him [Richter, a pianist], he looked immovably
at my fingers, and one day he said, &lsquo;My God! how I am obliged
to torment myself and sweat, and yet without obtaining applause;
and for you, my friend, it is mere play!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I had to labor
once in order not to show labor now&rsquo;&rdquo; (1784).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much easier to play rapidly than slowly; you can drop a few
notes in passages without anyone noticing it. But is it beautiful? At
such speed you can use the hands indiscriminately; but is that beautiful?&rdquo;
(1778.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the best clavier in Europe and at the same time hearers
who understand nothing or want to understand nothing, and who do
not feel what I play with me, and all my joy is gone&rdquo; (1778).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>andante</i> is going to give us the most trouble, for it is full of
expression and must be played with taste.... If I were her [Rose
Cannabich&rsquo;s] regular teacher, I would lock up all her music, cover the
keyboard with a handkerchief, and make her practice on nothing but
passages, trills, mordents, etc., until the difficulty with the left hand was
remedied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint-Sa&euml;ns, lover of irony and paradox, wrote a preface to his
edition of Mozart&rsquo;s pianoforte sonatas, published at Paris in 1915, in
which, after a discussion of the ornaments, he has this to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is accustomed in modern editions to be prodigal with <i>liaisons</i>,
to indicate constantly <i>legato</i>, <i>molto legato</i>, <i>sempre legato</i>. There is
nothing of this in the manuscripts and the old editions. Everything
leads us to believe that this music should be performed lightly, that
the figures should produce an effect analogous to that obtained on the
violin by giving a stroke to each note without leaving the string. When
Mozart wished the <i>legato</i>, he indicated it. In the middle of the last
century, pianists were still found whose playing was singularly leaping
(as one may say). The old non-<i>legato</i>, being exaggerated, became a
<i>staccato</i>. This exaggeration brought a reaction in the contrary sense,
and this was pushed too far....</p>
<p>&ldquo;This music of Mozart during his early years is destitute of nuances;
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
occasionally a <i>piano</i> or a <i>forte</i>; nothing more. The reason for this
abstinence is because these pieces were written for the clavecin, and its
sonority could not be modified by a pressure of the finger. Clavecins
with two keyboards could alternate with <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i>, but nuances,
properly speaking, were unknown to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 18th century, one lived more quietly than today, nor were
there in music our modern habits of speed, which is often inflicted on
ancient compositions to their great injury. It is necessary to shun in the
case of Mozart this tendency to hurry the movements, as too often
happens. His <i>presto</i> corresponds to our <i>allegro</i>; his <i>allegro</i> to our
<i>allegro moderato</i>. His <i>adagios</i> are extremely slow, as is shown by the
multiplicity of notes sometimes contained in a single beat. The <i>andante</i>
is not very slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the rule, in his time, not to put the thumb on a black key
except from absolute necessity. This method of fingering gives to the
hand great restfulness, precious for the performance of old music that
demands perfect equality of the fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first pianofortes were far from having the powerful sonority
of the great modern instruments. Therefore, it is not always necessary
to take Mozart&rsquo;s <i>forte</i> literally; it is often the equivalent of our <i>mezzo
forte</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c100"><span class="h2line1">SCYTHIAN SUITE, &ldquo;ALA AND LOLLI,&rdquo; OP. 20</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>The Adoration of Veles and Ala</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>The Enemy God and the Dance of the Black Spirits</dd>

<p>The ancient Scythians, wildly savage, had horrid manners and
customs. Herodotus tells us at pleasing length how they sacrificed
one in a hundred of their enemies to Mars; how in battle they
scalped their foes and drank their blood; how they burned false
prophets among their many soothsayers; how they strangled servants
of their dead king and seated them upon horses stuffed with
chaff to place about the monument. Truly a splendidly barbarous
folk.</p>
<p>And in his Scythian suite, Prokofieff has written superbly barbaric
music.</p>
<p>This music is something more than roaring, blaring dissonance;
something more than eccentric experimentation in harmonic
schemes and daring orchestration. The suite is deftly planned;
broadly conceived; carried out with rare dramatic intensity.</p>
<p>No matter how wild this music is, there is admirable method
in the madness; there is a refreshing mastery in the development
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
of the composer&rsquo;s purpose. He knew what he wanted; he gained
his effects. They are not episodic, spasmodic, but skillfully continuous.
The third movement, &ldquo;Night,&rdquo; is perhaps the most remarkable
in the revelation of poetically dramatic feeling. There is
&ldquo;the blackness of darkness&rdquo;&mdash;a night in which Nature herself
shudders and is afraid; a night when the Demon is master, and
strange, sinister deeds are wrought. Compare this movement with
the magnificent <i>finale</i> with its amazing climax.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This suite was composed in 1914. The first performance was at the
Imperial Maryinski Theater, Petrograd, on January 29, 1916. The composer
conducted.</p>
<p>The suite is scored for piccolo, three flutes, three oboes, English horn,
three clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, double bassoon, eight
horns, four trumpets, four trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, bass
drum, side drum, tambourine, cymbals, triangle, celesta, xylophone,
bells, two harps, pianoforte, and strings.</p>
<p>The four movements have this programme:</p>
<p>I. Invocation to Veles and Ala. <i>Allegro feroce</i>, 4-4 time. The music
describes an invocation to the sun, worshiped by the Scythians as their
highest deity, named Veles. This invocation is followed by the sacrifice
to the beloved idol, Ala, the daughter of Veles.</p>
<p>II. The Evil-God and dance of the pagan monsters. <i>Allegro sostenuto</i>,
4-4 time. The Evil-God summons the seven pagan monsters
from their subterranean realms and, surrounded by them, dances a
delirious dance.</p>
<p>III. Night. <i>Andantino</i>, 4-4 time. The Evil-God comes to Ala in the
darkness. Great harm befalls her. The moon rays fall upon Ala, and
the moon-maidens descend to bring her consolation.</p>
<p>IV. Lolli&rsquo;s pursuit of the Evil-God and the sunrise. <i>Tempestuoso</i>,
4-4 time. Lolli, a Scythian hero, went forth to save Ala. He fights the
Evil-God. In the uneven battle with the latter, Lolli would have perished,
but the Sun-God rises with the passing of night and smites the
evil deity. With the description of the sunrise the suite comes to an
end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Scythia is a name that has been applied to different countries at different
times. The Scythia described by Herodotus comprised the southeastern
parts of Europe between the Carpathian Mountains and the
river Tana&iuml;s (now Don). Herodotus gives a graphic and singularly
interesting account of these wild, barbaric nomads in the fourth book
of his history. We are interested here only with what he has to say
about their religion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They propitiate the following gods only: Vesta, most of all; then
Jupiter, deeming the Earth to be the wife of Jupiter; after these,
Apollo, and Venus Urania, and Hercules and Mars. All the Scythians
acknowledge these, but those who are called Royal Scythians sacrifice
also to Neptune. Vesta in the Scythian language is named Tabiti; Jupiter
is, in my opinion, very rightly called Pap&aelig;us; the Earth, Apia;
Apollo, &OElig;tosyrus; Venus Urania, Artimposa; and Neptune, Thamimasadas.
They are not accustomed to erect images, altars, and temples,
except to Mars; to him they are accustomed.&rdquo; Then follows a minute
description of the manner in which they sacrificed cattle and enemies
taken prisoners, the latter to Mars. &ldquo;Swine they never use, nor suffer
them to be reared in their country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prokofieff&rsquo;s symphony is a delightful little work, fresh, melodious,
vivacious, with significant themes; masterly, not pedantic treatment
of them; charming orchestration achieved by apparently simple
means, but showing consummate skill. The first movement and
the <i>finale</i> are in many measures truly Mozartean in mood, the
<i>larghetto</i> and the gavotte are more modern but in no way agressively
contradictory.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, begun in 1916, was completed in 1917. The first
performance was at Leningrad by the orchestra now known as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
State Orchestra. The first performance in the United States was at a
concert of the Russian Symphony Orchestra in New York, in December,
1918.</p>
<p>The symphony, scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two
bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, kettledrums, and strings, is dedicated
to Boris Assafieff, who, as Igor Gleboff, has written much about
music. &ldquo;The composer&rsquo;s idea in writing this work was to catch the
spirit of Mozart and to put down that which, if he were living now,
Mozart might put into his scores.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro</i>, D major, 4-4 time. The chief theme is given to the first
violins. A transitional passage has material for the flutes. Development
follows. The second theme is for first violins. The development begins
with use of the first subject. The transitional measures are taken up,
later the second theme. The recapitulation opens in C major (strings).
Then follows the transitional passage (D major) for the flute. The second
theme is again for the strings. There is a short <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>II. <i>Larghetto</i>, A major, 2-2 time. First violins announce the chief
theme. There are episodes.</p>
<p>III. <i>Gavotta</i>: <i>Non troppo allegro</i>, D major, 4-4 time. The subject is
given at once to strings and wood-wind. The trio is in G major (flutes
and clarinets above an organ point for violoncellos and double basses).
This subject is repeated by the strings.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale</i>: <i>Molto vivace</i>, D major, 2-2 time. The first theme is for
the strings; the second, A major, for wood-wind.</p>

<p>The composition is a long one; it lasts about an hour. The first
two movements seem by far the strongest, architecturally and emotionally.
The third movement seems insufferably long drawn out
and sentimental. The fourth movement gains on a second hearing&mdash;has
a more decided profile, and seems less episodic.</p>
<p>The reasons for the popularity of this symphony are not far to
seek. The themes are eminently melodious, and some of them
are of singular beauty; there is rich coloring; there are beautiful
nuances in color; there is impressive sonority; there are frequent
and sharp contrasts in sentiment, rhythm, expression; there is stirring
vitality. Mr. Rachmaninoff in this symphony is romantic in the
old and accustomed forms. He does not surprise or perplex by experiments
in harmony; his form is essentially academic and traditional.
Here is another case of new wine in old leather bottles,
but first of all the bottles were put in thorough order, patched,
strengthened, cleaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>Instantaneous popularity often indicates some weakness in a
composition. It will be interesting to watch the life of this symphony.
There was a time when Raff&rsquo;s <i>Lenore</i> was as rapturously
applauded. The most extravagant things were said about it. Raff
too had uncommon contrapuntal skill; he too was a fecund melodist;
he too had a pretty sense of color in his day. And what, pray,
has become of Raff&rsquo;s <i>Lenore</i>? It is in the great cemetery of orchestral
compositions buried snugly with its heroine and her Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Let us enjoy, however, the gifts the gods give us and not indulge
ourselves in gloomy thoughts. Mr. Rachmaninoff has written beautiful
and eloquent music in this symphony. He has shown technical
skill and revealed an emotional side that he has concealed in other
compositions. Whether he would show inspiration outside of traditional
forms; whether he has imagination in sufficient degree to
shape wondrous thoughts in a freer form and be a law not only
to himself but to his hearers&mdash;these questions we shall call unnecessary.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, composed at Dresden, was played at Moscow at a
concert of the Imperial Russian Music Society in the course of the season
of 1908-09. The composer conducted.</p>
<p>The symphony, dedicated to S. Tan&eacute;&iuml;ev, is scored for three flutes
(and piccolo), three oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet,
two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba,
kettledrums, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, glockenspiel, and the
usual strings.</p>
<p>There is an introduction, <i>largo</i>, 4-4, to the first movement. Violoncellos
and double basses give an indication of the chief motive. Sustained
chords of wind instruments follow, and over them appears the
leading thought of the symphony (violins). The solo for the basses is
repeated a third lower, and again chords for wind instruments follow.
(These passages for wind instruments are used reminiscently in the second
movement.) The violin theme is now more broadly developed,
and after a short <i>crescendo</i> a phrase for the English horn leads to the
main portion of the first movement, <i>allegro moderato</i>, E minor, 2-2.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>The first theme, <i>molto espressivo</i>, of the first movement, enters after
four measures of prelude and is given to the violins. A motive in
triplets for basses, <i>poco a poco pi&ugrave; vivo</i>, is added. This leads to a section,
<i>moderato</i>, in which, after preluding, a theme in G major is sung
by violins. This becomes more passionate, and leads to a close in G
major with a melody for violoncellos. The chief theme of the symphony
is developed in the working out, by solo violin, by the rest of
the strings and by wood-wind instruments. There is a noticeable
rhythmic figure for violas, and this slackening of the pace brings the
return of the chief theme of the movement with an elaborate <i>crescendo</i>.
There are fanfares for the brass, and a horn-call is freely used.
There is an agitated <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>Second movement, <i>allegro molto</i>, A minor, 2-2. The theme begins
with horns and is carried out by violins, while there are characteristic
figures for wood-wind instruments. The first section is constructed simply
and clearly from portions of this theme. There is a melodious section,
<i>moderato</i> (violins in octaves, violas, and violoncellos <i>cantabile</i>),
and then the energetic rhythmic figure brings in the repetition of the
first portion of the movement. The trio, <i>meno mosso</i>, begins with a
design for second violins, and its development includes march-like harmonies
for the brass. There is a free repetition of the <i>scherzo</i> portion,
and at the end a reminiscence of the theme for brass in the introduction.</p>
<p>The third movement, <i>adagio</i>, A major, 4-4, is in song form, and
there are three leading melodies in succession. The chief one is given
to the first violins; the clarinet has an expressive air; the third melody
is for oboes and violins. In the middle section there is a return to the
chief theme of the symphony. It occurs in dialogue form, and it also
appears at the end of the repetition of the first section.</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i>, <i>allegro vivace</i>, begins with a lively introduction which is
rhythmically developed out of the first jubilant motive for full orchestra.
There is a march theme for wind instruments. The second theme
is for strings, D major, and is in lyric mood. Many of the melodic figures
heard before enter in the <i>finale</i>. The climax of passion is reached
when the brass sounds forth the bass motive of the introductory <i>largo</i>,
and at the end the <i>adagio</i> theme is sung against the dance motive of
the <i>finale</i>.</p>

<p>The concerto is of uneven worth. The first movement is labored
and has little marked character. It might have been written by any
German, technically well-trained, who was acquainted with the
music of Tchaikovsky. The <i>adagio</i> and the <i>finale</i> have more racial
spirit and are well designed to win the favor of the crowd; the
<i>adagio</i> by its agreeable sentiment, the <i>finale</i> by the sharply defined
themes, the hustle and rush, the <i>crescendo</i> of excitement, with the
apotheosis, full vigor of the orchestra with a long, sweeping <i>cantilena</i>,
an obvious tune&mdash;truly an <i>ad captandum finale</i>.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This concerto was performed for the first time at a concert of the
Philharmonic Society of Moscow, October 14, 1901, when the composer
was the pianist. The concerto gained for the composer, in 1904, the
Glinka prize of 500 roubles, founded by the publisher Bela&iuml;ev. Published
in 1901, it is dedicated to N. Dahl.</p>
<p>The orchestral portion of the concerto is scored for two flutes, two
oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones
and bass tuba, kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, and the usual
strings.</p>
<p>Rachmaninoff has composed four pianoforte concertos: No. 1, F
sharp minor, Op. 1, was written in 1890-91 and revised in 1917; No. 2,
in C minor, 1900; No. 3, in D minor, 1909; No. 4, in G minor, 1927.</p>
<p>There follows a description of the Second concerto:</p>
<p>I. <i>Moderato</i>, C minor, 2-2. Introductory chords for the pianoforte
lead to the exposition of the first theme, which is given to the strings
while the pianoforte has an <i>arpeggio</i> figure in accompaniment. There
is a short orchestral interlude, and the second theme, E flat major, is
announced by the pianoforte. The presentation of this subject ends
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
with a <i>coda</i> in which there is passage-work for the pianoforte while
there is a suggestion of the first theme in the brass choir. The section
of development begins with a working out of the first motive, at first
in the orchestra. In the recapitulation, <i>maestoso, alla marcia</i>, the chief
theme is given to the strings, while there are chords for the brass and
a counter theme for the solo instrument. The horns take the second
theme in augmentation, <i>moderato</i>, A flat major. The material for the
<i>coda, meno mosso</i>, is taken from the chief theme, and the pianoforte
has passage-work.</p>
<p>II. <i>Adagio sostenuto</i>, E major, 4-4. There is a short introduction
with sustained harmonies for strings. These harmonies are soon reinforced
by wind instruments. The pianoforte enters with a figure over
which the flute and then the clarinet announce the theme on which
the movement is built. The opening phrase for the clarinet has much
significance in this respect. The pianoforte now has the theme, and
the accompaniment of a broken chord figure is given to violins (<i>pizzicato</i>)
and clarinets. The pace is quickened for the working out of the
subject and for episodic material. There is a <i>cadenza</i> for the pianoforte,
after which there is a repetition in part of the opening section. The
<i>coda</i> contains a new musical thought for the pianoforte: a progression
of chords in the upper part is accompanied by a broken chord figure
in the left, and wood-wind instruments play against this in triplets.</p>
<p>III. <i>Allegro scherzando</i>, C minor, 4-4. There are introductory measures,
and the first motive is for the pianoforte. This motive is developed.
The second motive is for oboe and violoncellos, and is taken up
later by the pianoforte and leads to figuration in triplets, <i>meno mosso</i>,
for the same instrument. Then comes a section <i>allegro scherzando</i>,
<i>moto primo</i>, in which the chief theme is further developed. There is
a <i>fugato</i>: the first violins are answered by pianoforte and lower strings.
In the recapitulation section there is a suggestion of the chief theme,
but the second motive is in the orchestra, this time for violins and
flute, and it is taken up later, as it was before, by the solo instrument.
The triplet figuration returns. <i>Allegro scherzando</i>: the chief theme is
treated in imitation by the orchestra. There is an increase in speed with
a <i>crescendo</i>, and, when the climax is reached, there is a <i>cadenza</i> for
the pianoforte. The second theme is announced by the full orchestra
<i>maestoso</i>, with chords for the solo instrument. There is a brilliant <i>coda</i>.</p>

<p>Ravel&rsquo;s music is of the most delicate texture, lacework with
exquisite thoughts orchestrated as for the little orchestra of ivory
instruments imagined by Jules Laforgue. Although to the eye the
structure of the score is simple, the performance demands the
utmost skill on the part of the players and the finest taste of an
imaginative conductor. It would be hard to say which of the five
movements is the most beautiful in fancy. The &ldquo;Pavane&rdquo; has a
subtle, melancholy charm. &ldquo;Hop o&rsquo; my Thumb&rdquo; is curiously
rhythmed and strangely effective by means of orchestration.
&ldquo;Laideronnette&rdquo; in the movement of a march is delightful, and
with the movement that follows, in the time of a slow waltz and
with a solo for the double bassoon representing the Beast, wins
<span class="pb" id="Page_235">235</span>
immediate popularity. In the ballet the Apotheosis was the &ldquo;Fairy
Garden,&rdquo; and this movement, too, is most poetic.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>These pieces were originally composed in 1908 for pianoforte (four
hands), and for the pleasure of the children, Mimie and Jean Godebski,
to whom they were dedicated when the pieces were published in 1910.
They were first performed at a concert of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Musicale Ind&eacute;pendante,
Salle Gaveau, Paris, on April 20, 1910. The pianists were
Christine Verger, six years old, and Germaine Duramy, ten years old.</p>
<p>I. &ldquo;Pavane of the Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo; <i>Lent</i>, A minor, 4-4. This movement
is only twenty measures long. It is based on the opening phrase
for flute, horns, and violas.</p>
<p>II. &ldquo;Hop o&rsquo; my Thumb.&rdquo; Ravel has quoted in the score this passage
from Perrault&rsquo;s tale: &ldquo;He believed that he would easily find his path
by means of his bread crumbs which he had scattered wherever he had
passed; but he was very much surprised when he could not find a single
crumb: the birds had come and eaten everything up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III. &ldquo;Laideronnette, Empress of the Pagodas.&rdquo; The French give the
name <i>pagode</i> to a little grotesque figure with a movable head, and
thus extend the meaning, which was also found in English for pagoda,
&ldquo;an idol or image.&rdquo; This latter use of the word is now obsolete in the
English language. A <i>laideron</i> is any ugly young girl or young woman.
There is this quotation from &ldquo;Serpentin Vert&rdquo; by the Countess Marie
Catherine d&rsquo;Aulnoy (about 1655-1705) who wrote romances and also
fairy tales in imitation of Perrault. &ldquo;She undressed herself and went
into the bath. The pagodes and pagodines began to sing and play on
instruments; some had theorbos made of walnut shells; some had viols
made of almond shells; for they were obliged to proportion the instruments
to their figure.&rdquo; Laideronnette, in the story, the daughter of a
king and queen, was cursed in her cradle by Magotine, a wicked fairy,
with the curse of the most horrible ugliness. When the princess grew
up, she asked that she might dwell far away in a castle where no one
could see her. In the forest near by she met a huge green serpent, who
told her that he was once handsomer than she was. Laideronnette had
many adventures. In a little boat, guarded by the serpent, she went out
to sea and was wrecked on the coast of a land inhabited by pagodes,
a little folk whose bodies were formed from porcelain, crystal, diamonds,
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
emeralds, etc. The ruler was an unseen monarch&mdash;the green
snake who also had been enchanted by Magotine. Finally, he was
changed into human shape, and he married Laideronnette, whose
beauty was restored.</p>
<p>IV. &ldquo;The Conversations of Beauty and the Beast.&rdquo; Quotations from
Mme Leprince de Beaumont are given:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When I think how good-hearted you are, you do not seem to me
so ugly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I have, indeed, a kind heart; but I am a monster.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There are many men more monstrous than you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If I had wit, I would invent a fine compliment to thank you, but I
am only a beast.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">. . . . . . .</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beauty, will you be my wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Beast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I die content since I have the pleasure of seeing you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, my dear Beast, you shall not die; you shall live to be my husband!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beast had disappeared, and she saw at her feet only a prince
more beautiful than Love, who thanked her for having broken his
enchantment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mouvement de valse tr&egrave;s mod&eacute;r&eacute;</i>,&rdquo; F major, 3-4. This movement is
based chiefly on a melody for the clarinet, which begins in the second
measure. There is a middle section with a subject suggesting the Beast
and given to the double bassoon. The two subjects are combined. At
the end, a solo violin plays the theme of the middle section.</p>
<p>V. &ldquo;The Fairy Garden.&rdquo; <i>Lent et grave</i>, C major, 3-4. The movement
is based on the opening theme for strings.</p>
<p>The orchestration is as follows: two flutes (and piccolo), two oboes
(and English horn), two clarinets, two bassoons, double bassoon, two
horns, kettledrums, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, xylophone,
glockenspiel, celesta, harp and strings.</p>

<p>Ravel&rsquo;s cunningly and gorgeously orchestrated ballet bears
separation from the stage and stage effects, the dancers and the
mimes. Nor is it necessary for one&rsquo;s enjoyment to be concerned
with the adventures of Daphnis and Chloe. Here is something
more than purple patches of instrumental color and dexterous
juggling with surprising combinations of timbres. There is form,
there is melody, there are ravishing harmonic devices; there is,
above all, poetic imagination.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Ravel composed his ballet, <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, expecting that it
would be performed by the Russian Ballet at Paris in 1911. Jacques
Durand, the publisher, says that Ravel was asked by Diaghilev in 1911
to write this ballet. Others give the year 1910. Durand also says
Diaghilev was not at first satisfied with the ballet and hesitated to produce
it, but Durand finally persuaded him; that Diaghilev&rsquo;s first unfavorable
impression was due to his knowing the music only by the
arrangement for piano. At the rehearsals there were violent scenes
between Fokine and Diaghilev, which led to the rupture which became
&ldquo;official&rdquo; after that season of the Ballet Russe. It was not performed
until June 5, 1912. The performances were at the Ch&acirc;telet. Nijinsky
mimed Daphnis; Mme Karsavina, Chloe. Messrs. Bolm and Cechetti
also took leading parts. The conductor was Mr. Monteux. The score,
however, was published in 1911. Two concert suites were drawn from
it. The first&mdash;&ldquo;Nocturne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Interlude,&rdquo; &ldquo;Danse Guerri&egrave;re&rdquo;&mdash;was performed
at a Ch&acirc;telet concert conducted by Gabriel Piern&eacute; on April 2,
1911.</p>
<p>The second suite is scored for two flutes (and piccolo), a flute in G,
two oboes, English horn, a clarinet in E flat, two clarinets in B flat,
bass clarinet in B flat, three bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, four
trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals,
triangle, tambourine, two side drums, castanets, celesta, glockenspiel,
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
two harps, strings (double basses with the low C), chorus of
mixed voices. This chorus, which sings without words, can be replaced
by variants inserted for this purpose in the orchestral parts.</p>
<p>The following argument is printed in the score of the suite to illustrate
the significance of the sections in succession:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sound but the murmur of rivulets fed by the dew that trickles
from the rocks. Daphnis lies stretched before the grotto of the nymphs.
Little by little the day dawns. The songs of birds are heard. Afar off a
shepherd leads his flock. Another shepherd crosses the back of the
stage. Herdsmen enter, seeking Daphnis and Chloe. They find Daphnis
and awaken him. In anguish he looks about for Chloe. She at last appears,
encircled by shepherdesses. The two rush into each other&rsquo;s arms.
Daphnis observes Chloe&rsquo;s crown. His dream was a prophetic vision:
the intervention of Pan is manifest. The old shepherd Lammon explains
that Pan saved Chloe, in remembrance of the nymph Syrinx,
whom the god loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daphnis and Chloe mime the story of Pan and Syrinx. Chloe impersonates
the young nymph wandering over the meadow. Daphnis as
Pan appears and declares his love for her. The nymph repulses him;
the god becomes more insistent. She disappears among the reeds. In
desperation he plucks some stalks, fashions a flute, and on it plays a
melancholy tune. Chloe comes out and imitates by her dance the
accents of the flute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dance grows more and more animated. In mad whirlings,
Chloe falls into the arms of Daphnis. Before the altar of the nymphs
he swears on two sheep his fidelity. Young girls enter; they are dressed
as Bacchantes and shake their tambourines. Daphnis and Chloe embrace
tenderly. A group of young men come on the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyous tumult. A general dance. Daphnis and Chloe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scenario of the ballet was derived by Michel Fokine from the
charming romance of Longus. There are stage pictures of Chloe carried
away by robbers, rescued by Pan at the prayer of Daphnis, and of
the lovers miming together the story of Pan and Syrinx. There are
scenes in the grove of Pan and in the pirate camp, besides those mentioned
above. The scenery and costumes were designed by Leon Bakst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<h2 id="c108"><span class="h2line1">BOLERO</span></h2>
<p><i>Bolero</i> does not fare the better by repetition. It is the clever
trick of a super-refined composer. The trick is amazingly well
performed, but it is only a trick. The surprise of a first performance
does not affect one a second time. Still, there is the expectation
of something going to happen, of a final, thunderous
proclamation of the inherently negligible tune. According to the
old saw, surprise is the chief element of wit. Perhaps&mdash;but honest
laughter follows the first cracking of a joke. After that, the laughter
is only courteous.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This <i>Bolero</i>, dedicated to Ida Rubinstein, was brought out by her
and danced by her at Paris in November, 1928. Alexandre Benois
designed the settings and the costumes to represent a scene that Goya
might have painted: a Spanish inn, with the dancer on a trestle table,
men surrounding it. At first calm, the actors on the Parisian stage were
little by little excited to frenzy as the dancer became more and more
animated. Knives were drawn&mdash;the woman was tossed from arms to
arms, until her partner intervened; they danced until quiet was restored.
So was the scene described by French and English reporters.</p>
<p>The first performance in the United States of this Bolero as a concert
piece was by the Philharmonic Society of New York, Mr. Toscanini
conductor, on November 14, 1929.</p>
<p><i>Tempo di ballo, moderato assai</i>, 3-4. A drum gives the dance
rhythm, which is maintained throughout; a flute announces the theme,
which is taken up by the wind instruments in turn; then by groups of
instruments. There is a <i>crescendo</i> for about twenty minutes, until there
is an explosive modulation&mdash;brass and percussion instruments swell the
din until at last there is what has been described as a &ldquo;tornado of
sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Pruni&egrave;res called attention to the fact that Ravel was not the first
to repeat a simple, common theme until by the monotony of tune and
rhythm the hearer was excited (as are Oriental hearers by the same
method). Padilla, the composer of <i>Valencia</i>, had worked this obsession
by the repetition of a tune for at least twenty times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Ravel&rsquo;s <i>Bolero</i> calls for these instruments: two flutes (and piccolo),
two oboes, oboe d&rsquo;amour, English horn, two clarinets, one E flat clarinet,
two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, four trumpets, three
trombones, bass tuba, high saxophone in F, soprano and tenor saxophones
in B flat, kettledrums, side drums, cymbal, tam-tam, celesta,
harp, and the usual strings.</p>

<dd><span class="cn">IV. </span>The Pines of the Appian Way</dd></dl>
<p>Respighi wrote <i>Pines of Rome</i> as a companion piece to his
<i>Fountains of Rome</i>. He may yet write &ldquo;<i>Hills of Rome</i>,&rdquo; but it
would have to be in seven movements. In the <i>Fountains of Rome</i>
he set no bird a-singing. In the third section [of the Pines of
Rome] &ldquo;Pines of the Janiculum,&rdquo; he introduces a nightingale.
Perhaps he had in mind the reply of the good King Agesilaus,
who, when a man was recommended to him as a skillful imitator
of that justly famous bird, replied: &ldquo;I have heard the nightingale
itself.&rdquo; So Respighi obtained a gramophone record of a nightingale
which he heard singing. The movement would not suffer if
there were no nightingale in the orchestra.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Pines of the Villa Borghese,&rdquo; where children are supposed
to be playing games, darting to and fro, shrieking, emitting
loud squeals of joy, the instrumentation is unusually brilliant,
effective, original. One finds more poetic feeling, more imagination
in &ldquo;Pines near a Catacomb,&rdquo; with the somber opening, the
solemnity of the double basses, the mysterious song which swells
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
and dies away. Yes, there is more poetic feeling in this movement
than in &ldquo;Pines of the Janiculum,&rdquo; with the moon full and the
gramophone turned on for the faint voice of the nightingale. At
first in the <i>finale</i> there is the rhythm of innumerable steps that
De Quincey might have heard at the beginning of his &ldquo;Dream
Fugue&rdquo; in &ldquo;The Vision of Sudden Death.&rdquo; There is the vision of
past glories, of soldiers victorious making their clashing and blaring
way to the Capitol; with the huzzaing crowd &ldquo;to see Great
Pompey pass the streets of Rome.&rdquo; This march is exciting by
reason of its rhythmic and dynamic increasing intensity and its
overpowering climax.</p>
<p>But if one takes the work poem as a whole, the composer is
revealed as a supreme master of orchestral color rather than a
man of fine, entrancing, impressive ideas.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphonic poem was composed in 1924. It was performed at
a concert in the Augusteum, Rome, in the season of 1924-25. The
score calls for 3 flutes (and piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets,
bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 1 trumpet off stage,
3 trumpets, 3 trombones and bass tuba, 6 buccine (the bucina was the
war trumpet of ancient Rome): 2 flicorni (Fluegelhorn) soprani, 2
flicorni tenori, 2 flicorni bassi&mdash;replaced if necessary by horns; kettledrums,
bass drum, cymbals, 2 small cymbals, tambourine, rattle, triangle,
tam-tam, harp, bells, celesta, gramophone (No. R. 6105 of the
Concert Record Gramophone&mdash;the &ldquo;Song of the Nightingale&rdquo;), pianoforte,
organ, and strings.</p>
<p>The piece is in four connected sections. They are based upon this
programme, printed as preface to the score:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. The Pines of the Villa Borghese. <i>Allegretto vivace</i>, 2-8. Children
are at play in the pine grove of the Villa Borghese, dancing the Italian
equivalent of &lsquo;Ring Around a-Rosy&rsquo;; mimicking marching soldiers and
battles; twittering and shrieking like swallows at evening; and they
disappear. Suddenly the scene changes to&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. The Pines near a Catacomb. <i>Lento</i>, 4-4; beginning with muted
and divided strings, muted horns, <i>piano</i>. We see the shadows of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
pines which overhang the entrance to a catacomb. From the depths
rises a chant which re&euml;choes solemnly, sonorously, like a hymn, and is
then mysteriously silenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. The Pines of the Janiculum. <i>Lento</i> 4-4; <i>piano cadenza</i>; clarinet
solo. There is a thrill in the air. The full moon reveals the profile of
the pines of Gianicolo&rsquo;s Hill. A nightingale sings (represented by a
gramophone record of a nightingale&rsquo;s song heard from the orchestra).</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. The Pines of the Appian Way. <i>Tempo di marcia.</i> Misty dawn
on the Appian Way. The tragic country is guarded by solitary pines.
Indistinctly, incessantly, the rhythm of innumerable steps. To the poet&rsquo;s
phantasy appears a vision of past glories; trumpets blare, and the army
of the consul advances brilliantly in the grandeur of a newly risen sun
toward the sacred way, mounting in triumph the Capitoline Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ernest Newman was facetious, hearing the symphonic poem at
a concert of the London Symphony Orchestra in October, 1925:
&ldquo;The tame nightingale in the last movement (a gramophone record,
&lsquo;kindly lent,&rsquo; as the programme informed us, &lsquo;by the Gramophone
Company, Hayes&rsquo;) did not communicate the expected thrill. Perhaps
the captive bird does not sing with the rapture of the free one. Perhaps
the proper romantic associations were lacking; it might have been
better had the lights been put out and we had all held hands. But I
fancy the explanation is that realism of this sort is a trifle too crude to
blend with music. We all remember Mr. Arnold Bennett&rsquo;s &lsquo;Card,&rsquo; who,
having bought in the days of his prosperity a painting of a Swiss scene
with a church tower in it, and still having enough of the Five Towns
left in him to want to fortify the beautiful with the useful, had a real
clock face inserted in the tower to tell him and the world the time.
Since then we have read of Mr. Harry Leon Wilson&rsquo;s little boy, who
used to gaze with a blend of fascination and terror on a picture of a
lion in a cage, the bars of the cage being real, inserted in the frame;
the great thing was to put your fingers behind the bars and half hope,
half fear that the lion would go for them. Musical realism of the
Respighi type has the same queer attractiveness and the same drawbacks.
Of course, if the public likes it, it can be extended indefinitely.
We may yet live to see the evening when the <i>Pastoral</i> symphony will
be given with real running water in the slow movement, nightingale
by the Gramophone Company, quail by Messrs. Fortnum and Mason.&rdquo;</p>

<dd><span class="cn">IV. </span>Festival at Baghdad. The Sea. The Ship Goes to Pieces against a Rock Surmounted by a Bronze Warrior. Conclusion</dd></dl>
<p>Rimsky-Korsakov wrote an argument for his score. The music
is in illustration of <i>Sindbad the Sailor</i>, the storm at sea, the shipwreck,
the tale of one of the three Kalandars, a tale of a prince
and a princess. The argument is not wholly clear, and probably
this was the composer&rsquo;s intention. What prince and what princess?
There are so many in <i>The Thousand Nights and a Night</i>. Who will
be so rash as to name the one of the three Kalandars? In the last
movement there is a festival at Baghdad, and lo, suddenly Sindbad&rsquo;s
ship sails to its fate.</p>
<p>In the ballet all this music is wedded to the story that is the
prelude to the wondrous tales: the story of the two rulers, their
wanton wives, and the resolve of one of the Kings to kill a
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
spouse every morning, until Scheherazade by her charm as a narrator
softens his heart. What then becomes of the graphic sea
music; or that illustrative of Kalandar, prince and princess? It is
not necessary to insist on the incongruity.</p>
<p>Unless a conductor can feel in this music the spirit of <i>The
Thousand Nights and a Night</i>, unless he is himself a rhapsodist
with admiration for the wild fancy, the humor now grotesque,
now cruel, now Rabelaisian, for the sensuousness that is at times
sensuality; unless there is understanding, with appreciation of
the imagination that peopled the air with slaves of King Solomon&rsquo;s
ring, hideous afreets and space-annihilating genii, his interpretation
will be that of a man who complains of endless repetitions
without contrapuntal development. The music is not for the
academic.</p>
<p>Grant that <i>Scheherazade</i> reeks at times of benzoin and the pastils
of the harem; that it suggests:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Manna and dates in argosy transferred</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>From silken Samarcand to cedared Lebanon</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>grant all this: there remains the superb sea music with the rolling
billows, the tossing, laboring vessel, the final crash and wild farewell.
There is more than a constant display of fancy or imagination.
The wonder is, as a matter of technic, how Rimsky-Korsakov
succeeds in casting his spell with analogous themes constantly
varied. Nor is this due solely to the surprising, masterly, and entrancing
instrumentation.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Scheherazade</i>, with the <i>Easter Overture</i>, was composed in the summer
of 1881 at Neyzhgovitsy on the shore of Lake Cheryemenyetskoye.
It was produced at St. Petersburg in the course of the following
concert season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>The suite, dedicated to Vladimir Stassov, is scored for piccolo, two
flutes, two oboes (and English horn), two clarinets, two bassoons, four
horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, snare
drum, bass drum, tambourine, cymbals, triangle, tam-tam, harp, and
strings.</p>
<p>The following programme is printed in Russian and French on a fly-leaf
of the score:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sultan Schahriar, persuaded of the falseness and the faithlessness
of women, has sworn to put to death each one of his wives after
the first night. But the Sultana Scheherazade saved her life by interesting
him in tales which she told him during one thousand and one
nights. Pricked by curiosity, the Sultan put off his wife&rsquo;s execution from
day to day, and at last gave up entirely his bloody plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many marvels were told Schahriar by the Sultana Scheherazade.
For her stories the Sultana borrowed from poets their verses, from folk
songs their words; and she strung together tales and adventures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rimsky-Korsakov has this to say about <i>Scheherazade</i> in <i>My Musical
Life</i>, translated into English by J. A. Joffe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The programme I had been guided by in composing <i>Scheherazade</i>
consisted of separate, unconnected episodes and pictures from <i>The
Arabian Nights</i>: the fantastic narrative of the Prince Kalandar, the
Prince and the Princess, the Baghdad festival, and the ship dashing
against the rock with the bronze rider upon it. The unifying thread
consisted of the brief introductions to Movements I, II, and IV, and the
<i>intermezzo</i> in Movement III, written for violin solo, and delineating
Scheherazade herself as telling her wondrous tales to the stern Sultan.
The conclusion of Movement IV serves the same artistic purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In vain do people seek in my suite leading motives linked always
and unvaryingly with the same poetic ideas and conceptions. On the
contrary, in the majority of cases, all these seeming leitmotives are
nothing but purely musical material, or the given motives for symphonic
development. These given motives thread and spread over all
the movements of the suite, alternating and intertwining each with
the other. Appearing as they do each time under different moods, the
self-same motives and themes correspond each time to different images,
actions and pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, for instance, the sharply outlined fanfare motive of the
muted trombone and trumpet, which first appears in the Kalandar&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
Narrative (Movement II) appears afresh in Movement IV, in the delineation
of the doomed ship, though this episode has no connection
with the Kalandar&rsquo;s Narrative. The principal theme of the Kalandar&rsquo;s
Narrative (B minor, 3-4) and the theme of the Princess in Movement
III (B flat major, 6-8, clarinet) in altered guise and quick tempo appear
as the secondary themes of the Baghdad festival; yet nothing is
said in <i>The Arabian Nights</i> about these persons taking part in the festivities.
The unison phrase, as though depicting Scheherazade&rsquo;s stern
spouse, at the beginning of the suite, appears in the Kalandar&rsquo;s Narrative,
where there cannot, however, be any thought of Sultan
Schahriar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner, developing quite freely the musical data taken as a
basis of the composition, I had in view the creation of an orchestral
suite in four movements, closely knit by the community of its themes
and motives, yet presenting, as it were, a kaleidoscope of fairy-tale
images and designs of Oriental character&mdash;a method that I had to a
certain degree made use of in my <i>Skazka</i> (Fairy Tale), the musical
data of which are as little distinguishable from the poetic as they are
in <i>Scheherazade</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In composing <i>Scheherazade</i> I meant these hints to direct but slightly
the hearer&rsquo;s fancy on the path which my own fancy had traveled, and
to leave more minute and particular conceptions to the will and mood
of each listener. All I had desired was that the hearer, if he liked my
piece <i>as symphonic music</i>, should carry away the impression that it is
beyond doubt an Oriental narrative of some numerous and varied fairy-tale
wonders, and not merely four pieces played one after the other
and composed on the basis of themes common to all the four movements.
Why, then, if that be the case, does this name and the subtitle
(&lsquo;After <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>&rsquo;) connote in everybody&rsquo;s mind
the East and fairy-tale wonders; besides, certain details of the musical
exposition hint at the fact that all of these are various tales of some
one person (which happens to be Scheherazade) entertaining therewith
her stern husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A characteristic theme, the typical theme of <i>Scheherazade</i>, keeps appearing
in the four movements. This theme, that of the Narrator, is a
florid melodic phrase in triplets, and it ends generally in a free <i>cadenza</i>.
It is played, for the most part, by a solo violin; sometimes by a wood-wind
instrument. &ldquo;The presence in the minor cadence of the characteristic
seventh, G, and the major sixth, F sharp&mdash;after the manner of
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
the Phrygian mode of the Greeks or the Doric church tone&mdash;might
illustrate the familiar beginning of all folk tales, &lsquo;Once upon a time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. The Sea and Sindbad&rsquo;s Ship. <i>Largo e maestoso</i>, E minor, 2-2. The
chief theme of this movement, proclaimed frequently and in many
transformations, has been called by some the &ldquo;Sea&rdquo; motive, by others
the &ldquo;Sindbad&rdquo; motive. It is proclaimed immediately and heavily in
fortissimo unison and octaves. Soft chords of wind instruments&mdash;chords
not unlike the first chords of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; overture in character&mdash;lead to the &ldquo;Scheherazade&rdquo; motive,
lento, 4-4, played by solo violin against chords of the harp. Then follows
the main body of the movement, allegro non troppo, E major,
6-4, which begins with a combination of the chief theme, the &ldquo;sea&rdquo;
motive, with a rising and falling arpeggio figure, the &ldquo;wave&rdquo; motive.
There is a crescendo. A modulation leads to C major. Wood-wind instruments
and violoncellos pizzicato introduce a motive that has been
called the &ldquo;ship,&rdquo; at first for solo flute, then oboe, lastly, clarinet. A
reminiscence of the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; motive is heard from the horn between the
phrases. A solo violoncello continues the &ldquo;wave&rdquo; motive, which in one
form or another persists almost throughout the whole movement. The
&ldquo;Scheherazade&rdquo; motive soon enters (solo violin). There is a long period
that at last re&euml;stablishes the chief tonality, E major. The &ldquo;sea&rdquo; motive
is sounded by full orchestra. The development is easily followed.
There is an avoidance of contrapuntal use of thematic material. The
style of the composer in this suite is homophonous, not polyphonic.
He prefers to produce his effects by melodic, harmonic, rhythmic transformations
and by most ingenious and highly colored orchestration.
The movement ends tranquilly.</p>
<p>II. The Story of the Kalandar Prince. The second movement opens
with a recitative-like passage, <i>lento</i>, B minor, 4-4. A solo violin accompanied
by the harp gives out the &ldquo;Scheherazade&rdquo; motive, with a different
<i>cadenza</i>. There is a change to a species of <i>scherzo</i> movement,
<i>andantino</i>, 3-8. The bassoon begins the wondrous tale, <i>capriccioso
quasi recitando</i>, accompanied by the sustained chords of four double
basses. The beginning of the second part of this theme occurs later and
transformed. The accompaniment has the bagpipe drone. The oboe
then takes up the melody, then the strings with quickened pace, and
at last the wind instruments, <i>un poco piu animato</i>. The chief motive
of the first movement is heard in the basses. A trombone sounds a
fanfare, which is answered by the trumpet; the first fundamental
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
theme is heard, and an <i>allegro moto</i> follows, derived from the preceding
fanfare, and leads to an orientally colored <i>intermezzo</i>. &ldquo;There
are curious episodes in which all the strings repeat the same chord
over and over again in rapid succession&mdash;very like the responses of a
congregation in church&mdash;as an accompaniment to the &lsquo;Scheherazade&rsquo;
motive, now in the clarinet, now in the bassoon.&rdquo; The last interruption
leads to a return of the Kalandar&rsquo;s tale, <i>con moto</i>, 3-8, which is developed,
with a few interruptions from the &ldquo;Scheherazade&rdquo; motive.
The whole ends gayly.</p>
<p>III. The Young Prince and the Young Princess. Some think from a
similarity of the two themes typical of prince and princess that the composer
had in mind the adventures of Kamar al-Zaman (Moon of the
Age) and the Princess Budur (Full Moons). &ldquo;They were the likest of
all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister,&rdquo;
and over the question which was the more beautiful, Maymunah,
the Jinniyah, and Dabnash, the Ifrit, disputed violently.</p>
<p>This movement is in simple <i>romanza</i> form. It consists in the long
but simple development of two themes of folk-song character. The first
is sung by the violins, <i>andantino quasi allegretto</i>, G major, 6-8. There
is a constant recurrence of songlike melody between phrases in this
movement, of quickly rising and falling scale passages, as a rule in the
clarinet, but also in the flute or first violins. The second theme, <i>pochissimo
piu mosso</i>, B flat major and G minor, 6-8, introduces a section
characterized by highly original and daringly effective orchestration.
There are piquant rhythmic effects from a combination of triangle,
tambourine, snare drum, and cymbals, while violoncellos (later the
bassoon) have a sentimental counter phrase.</p>
<p>IV. Festival at Baghdad. The Sea. The Ship Goes to Pieces Against
a Rock Surmounted by a Bronze Warrior. Conclusion. <i>Allegro molto</i>,
E minor, 6-8. The <i>finale</i> opens with a reminiscence of the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; motive
of the first movement, proclaimed in unisons and octaves. Then
follows the &ldquo;Scheherazade&rdquo; motive (solo violin), which leads to the
f&ecirc;te in Baghdad, <i>Allegro molto e frenetico</i>, E minor, 6-8. The musical
portraiture, somewhat after the fashion of a tarantelle, is based on a
version of the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; motive, and it is soon interrupted by Scheherazade
and her violin. In the movement <i>vivo</i>, E minor, there is a combination
of 2-8, 6-16, 3-8 times, and two or three new themes, besides those
heard in the preceding movements, are worked up elaborately. The
festival is at its height&mdash;&ldquo;This is indeed life; O sad that &rsquo;tis fleeting&rdquo;&mdash;when
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
there seems to be a change of festivities, and the jollification to
be on shipboard. In the midst of the wild hurrah the ship strikes the
magnetic rock.</p>
<p>The trombones roar out the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; motive against the billowy &ldquo;wave&rdquo;
motive in the strings, <i>Allegro non troppo e maestoso</i>, C major, 6-4;
and there is a modulation to the tonic, E major, as the tempest rages.
The storm dies. Clarinets and trumpets scream one more cry on the
march theme of the second movement. There is a quiet ending with
development of the &ldquo;sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;wave&rdquo; motives. The tales are told.
Scheherazade, the narrator, who lives with Shahryar &ldquo;in all pleasance
and solace of life and its delights till there took them the Destroyer of
delights and the Severer of societies, the Desolator of dwelling places
and Garnerer of graveyards, and they were translated to the ruth of
Almighty Allah,&rdquo; fades with the vision and the final note of her
violin.</p>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <i>Capriccio Espagnol</i> was performed for the first
time in St. Petersburg at a Russian Symphony concert, October 31,
1887. The composer conducted. The caprice was published in 1887,
yet we find Tchaikovsky writing to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1886 (November
11): &ldquo;I must add that your <i>Spanish Caprice</i> is a colossal masterpiece
of instrumentation, and you may regard yourself as the greatest
master of the present day.&rdquo; Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in his <i>Autobiography</i>:
&ldquo;The opinion formed by both critics and public, that the <i>capriccio</i>
is a magnificently orchestrated piece, is wrong. The <i>capriccio</i> is a
brilliant composition for the orchestra. The change of timbres, the
felicitous choice of melodic designs and figuration patterns, exactly
suiting each instrument, brief virtuoso <i>cadenzas</i> for instrument solo,
the rhythm of the percussion instruments, etc., constitute here the very
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
essence of the composition and not its garb or orchestration. All in all,
the <i>capriccio</i> is a purely external piece, but vividly brilliant for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caprice is dedicated to the artists of the orchestra of the Imperial
Russian Opera House of St. Petersburg. The names, beginning
with M. Koehler and R. Kaminsky, are given, sixty-seven in all, on the
title-page of the score. The caprice is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two
oboes (and English horn), two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two
trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, side drum, bass
drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, castanets, harp, and strings.</p>
<p>It was in the summer of 1887 that Rimsky-Korsakov, purposing at
first to use Spanish dance themes for a virtuoso violin piece, sketched
instead this caprice. He thought the third section, the &ldquo;Alborada&rdquo; in
B flat major, to be a little less successful than the other sections, on
account of the brass somewhat drowning the melodic designs of the
wood-wind, but this fault could be remedied by a careful conductor.
Rimsky-Korsakov tells how, at the rehearsal in St. Petersburg, the
orchestra applauded vigorously after the first movement, and in fact
after those succeeding, and the composer was so pleased that he dedicated
the <i>capriccio</i> to the players. He also says that the first performance
was extraordinarily brilliant, more so than when it was later
led by others, even by Arthur Nikisch.</p>
<p>The movements, according to the direction of the composer, are to
be played without intervening pauses.</p>
<p>I. Alborada. <i>Vivo e strepitoso.</i> This serenade opens with the wild,
tempestuous chief theme, which is given to the full orchestra. There is
a subsidiary theme for the wood-wind instruments. Both themes are repeated
twice by solo clarinet, accompanied by horns and bassoons, and
strings <i>pizzicato</i>. A delicate <i>cadenza</i> for solo violin brings the close,
<i>pianissimo</i>.</p>
<p>II. Variations. <i>Andante con moto</i>, F major, 3-8. The horns give out
the theme with a rocking accompaniment for strings. Before this theme
is ended, the strings have the first variation. The second variation,
<i>poco meno mosso</i>, is a dialogue between English horn and horn. The
third variation is for full orchestra. The fourth, <i>tempo primo</i>, E major,
organ-point on B, is for wood-wind, two horns, and two violoncellos,
accompanied by sixteenth notes for clarinet and violins. The fifth, F
major, is for full orchestra. A <i>cadenza</i> for solo flute brings the end.</p>
<p>III. Alborada. <i>Vivo e strepitoso</i>, B flat major, 2-4. This movement is
a repetition of the first, transposed to B flat major and with different
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
orchestration. Clarinets and violins have now exchanged their parts.
The solo that was originally for clarinet is now for solo violin; the
<i>cadenza</i> that was originally for the solo violin is now for the solo
clarinet.</p>
<p>IV. Scene and Gypsy Song. <i>Allegro</i>, D minor, 6-8. This dramatic
scene is a succession of five <i>cadenzas</i>. The movement begins abruptly
with a roll of side drum, with a fanfare, quasi-<i>cadenza</i>, in syncopated
rhythm, gypsy fashion, for horns and trumpets. The drum roll continues,
now <i>pianississimo</i>. The second <i>cadenza</i>, which is for solo violin,
introduces the chief theme. This is repeated by flute and clarinet. The
third <i>cadenza</i>, freer in form, is for flute over a kettledrum roll; the
fourth, also free, for clarinet over a roll of cymbals. The fifth <i>cadenza</i>
is for harp with triangle.</p>
<p>The gypsy song begins after a harp <i>glissando</i>.</p>
<p>The song is attacked savagely by the violins and is punctuated by
trombone and tuba chords and cymbal strokes. The <i>cadenza</i> theme
enters, full orchestra, with a characteristic figure for accompaniment.
The two themes are alternated. There is a side theme for solo violoncello.
Then the strings, in guitar fashion, hint at the fandango rhythm
of the <i>finale</i>, and accompany the gypsy song, which is now blown
<i>staccato</i> by wood-wind instruments. The <i>cadenza</i> theme is enwrapped
in triplets for strings alternating with harmonics <i>pizzicato</i>. The pace
grows more and more furious, <i>animato</i>, and leads into the <i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>V. Fandango of the Asturias. A major, 3-4.</p>
<p>The chief theme of the fandango in this <i>Spanish Caprice</i> is announced
immediately by the trombones, and a related theme for wood-wind
instruments follows. Both themes are repeated by oboes and violins,
while flutes and clarinets have figured in accompaniment. There is
a variation in dance form for solo violin. The chief theme in a modified
version is given to bassoons and violoncellos. The clarinet has a
solo with fandango accompaniment, and the dance grows more and
more furious until the chief theme is heard again from the trombones.
The <i>fandango</i> suddenly is changed into the &ldquo;Alborada&rdquo; of the first
movement, <i>Coda, vivo</i>. There is a short closing <i>presto</i>.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">SAINT-SA&Euml;NS</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Paris, October 9, 1835; died at Algiers, December 16, 1921)</p>
<p>An enemy of Saint-Sa&euml;ns&mdash;and Saint-Sa&euml;ns made enemies by his
barbed words&mdash;might have applied to him the lines of Juvenal:</p>
<div class="verse"><p class="t0"><i>Grammaticus, rhetor, geometres, pictor, aliptes,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Augur, Schoenobates, medicus, magus, omnia novit.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Graeculus esuriens in coelum, jusseris, ibit</i>&mdash;<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p></div>
<p>for Saint-Sa&euml;ns was not satisfied with the making of music or
the career of a virtuoso. Organist, pianist, caricaturist, dabbler in
science, enamored of mathematics and astronomy, amateur
comedian, feuilletonist, critic, traveler, arch&aelig;ologist&mdash;he was a
restless man.</p>
<p>He was of less than average height, thin, nervous, sick-faced;
with great and exposed forehead, hair habitually short, beard
frosted. His eyes were almost level with his face. His eagle-beak
would have excited the admiration of Sir Charles Napier, who
once exclaimed: &ldquo;Give me a man with plenty of nose.&rdquo; Irritable,
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
whimsical, ironical, paradoxical, indulging in sudden changes of
opinion, he was faithful to friends, appreciative of certain rivals,
kindly disposed toward young composers, zealous in practical assistance
as well as in verbal encouragement. A man that knew
the world and sparkled in conversation; fond of society; at ease
and on equal terms with leaders in art, literature, fashion. A man
whose Monday receptions were long famous in Paris, eagerly
anticipated by <i>Tout Paris</i>; yet never so happy as when acting
Calchas to Bizet&rsquo;s or Regnault&rsquo;s Helen in Offenbach&rsquo;s delightful
<i>La Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, or impersonating in an extraordinary costume
Gounod&rsquo;s Marguerite surprised by the casket of jewels. An indefatigable
student of Bach, he parodied the Italian opera of the
&rsquo;thirties, &rsquo;forties, &rsquo;fifties in <i>Gabriella di Vergi</i>.</p>
<p>Then there is his amusing <i>Carnival des Animaux</i>, which was
written, as his <i>Gabriella di Vergi</i>, without intention of publication.
A Parisian from crown of head to sole of foot; yet a nomad.</p>
<p>In 1867 Berlioz called Saint-Sa&euml;ns &ldquo;one of the greatest musicians
of our epoch.&rdquo; In 1878 B&uuml;low lamented in a letter to Hans von
Bronsart that there was no musician in Germany like Saint-Sa&euml;ns
&ldquo;except you and me.&rdquo; Liszt&rsquo;s admiration for Saint-Sa&euml;ns is well
known. In 1918 there were some, even in this country, who
applauded him as the greatest living composer. On the other hand,
there have been critics who said that he was too much of a
musician to be a great composer or creator. The praise of Gounod&mdash;&ldquo;Saint-Sa&euml;ns
will write at will a work <i>&agrave; la Rossini</i>, <i>&agrave; la Verdi</i>,
<i>&agrave; la Schumann</i>, <i>&agrave; la Wagner</i>&rdquo;&mdash;was counted by them a reproach;
it was regarded as a courteous manner of saying, &ldquo;Saint-Sa&euml;ns has
the unfortunate faculty of assimilation.&rdquo; Hugues Imbert, discussing
him, admitted that there is no graver censure than to say of an
artist, &ldquo;He is incapable of being himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far as an intimate knowledge of music as a science is concerned,
so far as fluency and ease of expression are concerned,
Saint-Sa&euml;ns was beyond a doubt a remarkable musician.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>An extraordinary man and musician. Possessing an uncommon
technical equipment as composer, pianist, organist; French in
clearness of expression, logic, exquisite taste; a master of rhythm,
with a clear appreciation of tonal color and the value of simplicity
in orchestration, he is seldom warm and tender; seldom does he
indulge himself in sentiment, passion, imagination. With him
orthodox form must always be kept in mind. Hence perhaps the
reactionary attitude of his later years; his sharp criticism of the
more modern school of French composers, including C&eacute;sar Franck.
His wit and brilliancy are indisputable. He seldom touches the
heart or sweeps away the judgment. He was not a great creator,
yet his name is ever to be mentioned with respect. Without consideration
of his many admirable compositions, one should bear
this in mind: In the face of difficulties, discouragement, misunderstanding,
sneers, he worked steadily from his youth up, and always
to the best of his ability, for righteousness in absolute music; he
endeavored to introduce into French music thoughtfulness and
sincerity for the advantage and the glory of the country that he
dearly loved.</p>
<h2 id="c115"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 3, IN C MINOR (WITH ORGAN), OP. 78</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>Adagio; allegro moderato; poco adagio</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Allegro moderato; presto; maestoso; allegro</dd></dl>
<p>Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo; Symphony in C minor has the finest and most
characteristic qualities of the best French music: logical construction,
lucidity, frankness, euphony. The workmanship is masterly.
There is no hesitation. The composer knew exactly what he wanted
and how to express himself. A few of the themes that when first
exposed might seem to some insignificant assume importance and
even grandeur in the development. The chief theme of the <i>adagio</i>,
the theme for strings, is very French in its sustained suavity, in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
gentle, emotional quality that never loses elegance, and the preparation
for the entrance of this <i>adagio</i> is worthy of the greatest
masters. It is not necessary to speak of the many beautiful or
stirring pages; of the consummate skill of the technician; of the
unerring instrumentation.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was composed for the London Philharmonic Society
and first performed at a concert of that society in London, May 19,
1886, when the composer conducted. It was performed at Aix-la-Chapelle
in September of that year under the direction of the composer.</p>
<p>For the first performance in London, Saint-Sa&euml;ns prepared the following
analysis, which was translated into English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This symphony is divided into two parts, after the manner of Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo;
Fourth concerto for piano and orchestra and Sonata for piano
and violin. Nevertheless, it includes practically the traditional four
movements: the first, checked in development, serves as an introduction
to the <i>adagio</i>, and the <i>scherzo</i> is connected, after the same manner, with
the <i>finale</i>. The composer has thus sought to shun in a certain measure
the interminable repetitions which are more and more disappearing
from instrumental music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The composer thinks that the time has come for the symphony to
benefit by the progress of modern instrumentation, and he therefore
establishes his orchestra as follows: three flutes, two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four
horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, three kettledrums, organ,
pianoforte (now for two hands and now for four), triangle, a pair of
cymbals, bass drum, and the usual strings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After an introduction <i>adagio</i> of a few plaintive measures the string
quartet exposes the initial theme, which is somber and agitated
(<i>allegro moderato</i>). The first transformation of this theme leads to a
second motive, which is distinguished by greater tranquillity; after a
short development, in which the two themes are presented simultaneously,
the motive appears in a characteristic form, for full orchestra,
but only for a short time. A second transformation of the initial theme
includes now and then the plaintive notes of the introduction. Varied
episodes bring gradually calm, and thus prepare the <i>adagio</i> in D flat.
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
The extremely peaceful and contemplative theme is given to the
violins, violas, and violoncellos, which are supported by organ chords.
This theme is then taken by clarinet, horn, and trombone, accompanied
by strings divided into several parts. After a variation (in arabesques)
performed by the violins, the second transformation of the initial theme
of the <i>allegro</i> appears again, and brings with it a vague feeling of unrest,
which is enlarged by dissonant harmonies. These soon give way to
the theme of the <i>adagio</i>, performed this time by some of the violins,
violas, and violoncellos, with organ accompaniment and with a persistent
rhythm of triplets presented by the preceding episode. This
first movement ends in a <i>coda</i> of mystical character, in which are heard
alternately the chords of D flat major and E minor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second movement begins with an energetic phrase (<i>allegro
moderato</i>), which is followed immediately by a third transformation
of the initial theme in the first movement, more agitated than it was
before, and into which enters a fantastic spirit that is frankly disclosed
in the <i>presto</i>. Here arpeggios and scales, swift as lightning, on the
pianoforte, are accompanied by the syncopated rhythm of the orchestra,
and each time they are in a different tonality (F, E, E flat, G). This
tricky gayety is interrupted by an expressive phrase (strings). The
repetition of the <i>allegro moderato</i> is followed by a second <i>presto</i>, which
at first is apparently a repetition of the first <i>presto</i>; but scarcely has it
begun before a new theme is heard, grave, austere (trombone, tuba,
double basses), strongly contrasted with the fantastic music. There is
a struggle for the mastery, and this struggle ends in the defeat of the
restless, diabolical element. The phrase rises to orchestral heights, and
rests there as in the blue of a clear sky. After a vague reminiscence of
the initial theme of the first movement, a <i>maestoso</i> in C major announces
the approaching triumph of the calm and lofty thought. The
initial theme of the first movement, wholly transformed, is now exposed
by divided strings and the pianoforte (four hands), and repeated by
the organ with the full strength of the orchestra. Then follows a development
built in a rhythm of three measures. An episode of a
tranquil and pastoral character (oboe, flute, English horn, clarinet) is
twice repeated. A brilliant <i>coda</i>, in which the initial theme by a last
transformation takes the form of a violin figure, ends the work; the
rhythm of three measures becomes naturally and logically a huge

<p>This symphony is dedicated to the memory of Franz Liszt.</p>
<p>Liszt died at Bayreuth, July 31, 1886. The symphony was performed
at London before his death. When Liszt was in Paris in March of 1886
to hear the performance of his <i>Graner Messe</i> at St. Eustache, the symphony
was nearly completed, and Saint-Sa&euml;ns gave Liszt an idea of it
by playing it on the pianoforte. The statement that Saint-Sa&euml;ns intended
the symphony to be &ldquo;a funereal memorial and an apotheosis of the
glorious master&rdquo; is nonsensical. The dedication was a posthumous
tribute.</p>

<p>Schoenberg&rsquo;s music, to be enjoyed, does not need either the
original verse or the paraphrase. Indeed, it would be better if the
argument were not printed for the concertgoer. As it is, he may
be too anxious to discover the emancipated woman and the good,
easy-going, complaisant man in the music, and be oblivious of the
strains of beauty and passion. For this music, on the whole prolix,
has beautiful and passionate pages of compelling eloquence. Other
pages are a sandy, dreary waste. The impression would be still
stronger, the music still more significant, if the composition were
much shorter. Whether the music itself gains by the revision and
enlargement, is a question that admits of discussion.</p>

<p>This piece, originally a sextet, was published in 1905; the arrangement
for string orchestra was published in 1917. The sextet was composed
in 1899.</p>
<p>An excerpt from Richard Dehmel&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;Weib und die Welt,&rdquo; is
printed on a flyleaf of the score. When the sextet was first performed
in New York by the Kneisel Quartet, Mr. Krehbiel paraphrased this
poetic fragment as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two mortals walk through a cold, barren grove. The moon sails
over the tall oaks, which send their scrawny branches up through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
unclouded moonlight. A woman speaks. She confesses a sin to the man
at her side: she is with child, and he is not its father. She had lost
belief in happiness, and, longing for life&rsquo;s fullness, for motherhood and
mother&rsquo;s duty, she had surrendered herself, shuddering, to the embraces
of a man she knew not. She had thought herself blessed, but now life
had avenged itself upon her, by giving her the love of him she walked
with. She staggers onward, gazing with lack-lustre eye at the moon
which follows her. A man speaks. Let her not burden her soul with
thoughts of guilt. See, the moon&rsquo;s sheen enwraps the universe. Together
they are driving over chill waters, but a flame from each warms
the other. It, too, will transfigure the little stranger, and she will bear
the child to him. For she has inspired the brilliant glow within him
and made him too a child. They sink into each other&rsquo;s arms. Their
breaths meet in kisses in the air. Two mortals wander through the
wondrous moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">SCHUBERT</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Lichtenthal, near Vienna, January 31, 1797; died at Vienna, November 19, 1828)</p>
<p>Schubert was a clumsy man, short, round-shouldered, tallow-faced,
with a great shock of black hair, with penetrating though
spectacled eyes, strong-jawed, stubby-fingered. He shuffled in his
walk, and he expressed himself in speech with difficulty. He
described himself as unhappy, miserable; but his practical jokes
delighted tavern companions, and he was proud of his performance
of <i>The Erlking</i> on a comb. He kept a diary and jotted down
platitudes. He had little taste for literature, painting, sculpture,
travels; he was not interested in politics or in questions of sociology.
He went with his own kind. Unlike Beethoven, he could
not impose on the aristocracy of Vienna. He loved the freedom of
the tavern, the dance in the open air or late at night, when he
would play pretty tunes for the dancers. Handel was the superb
personage of music. Gluck was a distinguished person at the
Court of Marie Antoinette; Sarti pleased the mighty Catherine of
Russia; Rossini, the son of a strolling horn player, was at ease
with royalty and worshiped by women. There is little in the plain
life of Schubert to fire the zeal of the anecdotical or romantic
biographer. No Grimm, no Diderot, relished his conversation.
There is no gossip of noble and perfumed dames looking on him
favorably. There is a legend that he was passionately in love with
Caroline of the House of Esterhazy; but his passion followed a
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
spell of interest in a pretty housemaid. He sang love in immortal
strains; but women were not drawn towards him as they were
towards Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven&mdash;the list is a long one. He
was not a spectacularly heroic figure. His morbidness has not
the inviting charm of Schumann&rsquo;s torturing introspection. We
sympathize more deeply with the sufferings of Mozart, and yet
the last years of Schubert were perhaps as cruel. Dittersdorf is
close to us by his autobiography. Smug Blangini amuses by his
vanity and by his indiscreet defence of Pauline Bonaparte, his
pupil. No one can imagine Schubert philosophizing in books after
the fashion of Wagner, Gounod, Saint-Sa&euml;ns. It would have been
easier for him to write a dozen symphonies than a feuilleton in
the manner of Hector Berlioz. Schubert was a simple, kindly,
loving, honest man, whose trade, whose life, was music.</p>
<p>Schubert thought in song even when he wrote for the pianoforte,
string quartet, or orchestra. The songs which he wrote in too
great number were composed under all sorts of conditions, almost
always hurriedly, in the fields, in the tavern, in bed. There were
German songs before Schubert&mdash;folk songs, songs of the church,
set songs for home and concert; but Schubert created a new
lyric&mdash;the emotional song. Plod your weary way through the
ballads of Zumsteeg, the songs of J. A. Hiller, Reichardt, Zelter,
and the others: how cold, formal, precise they are! They are like
unto the cameo brooches that adorn the simpering women in old
tokens or keepsakes; as remote and out of fashion as the hair
jewelry of the early &rsquo;sixties. Take away &ldquo;The Violet,&rdquo; and what
interest is there in Mozart&rsquo;s book of songs? There is Haydn&rsquo;s
famous <i>Canzonet</i>; there is perhaps Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;In Questa Tomba&rdquo;
with a few of the songs addressed to the &ldquo;<i>Ferne Geliebte</i>&rdquo;; but
Beethoven knew the voice best as an orchestral instrument. The
modern song was invented by Franz Schubert.</p>
<p>The striking characteristics of Schubert&rsquo;s songs, spontaneity,
haunting melody, a birthright mastery over modulation, a singular
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
good fortune in finding the one inevitable phrase for the prevailing
sentiment of the poem and in finding the fitting descriptive figure
for salient detail, are also found in the best of his instrumental
works.</p>
<p>There is the spontaneous simplicity, the simplicity praised by
Walt Whitman: &ldquo;The art of art, the glory of expression is simplicity.
To speak with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of
the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the
sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside is the
flawless triumph of art. The greatest poet swears to his art: &lsquo;I
will not be meddlesome. I will not have in my writing any elegance
or effect or originality to hang in the way between me and the
rest like curtains. What I tell, I tell for precisely what it is. Let
who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes
as health or heat or snow has, and be as regardless of
observation. What I experience or portray shall go from my
composition without a shred of my composition. You shall stand
by my side and look in the mirror with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there is the ineffable melancholy that is the dominating
note. There is gayety such as was piped na&iuml;vely by William Blake
in his <i>Songs of Innocence</i>; there is the innocence that even Mozart
hardly reached in his frank gayety; yet in the gayety and innocence
is a melancholy&mdash;despairing, as in certain songs of &ldquo;The Winter
Journey,&rdquo; when Schubert smelled the mould and knew the earth
was impatiently looking for him&mdash;a melancholy that is not the
titanic despair of Beethoven, not the whining or shrieking pessimism
of certain German and Russian composers; it is the melancholy
of an autumnal sunset, of the ironical depression due to a
burgeoning noon in spring, the melancholy that comes between
the lips of lovers.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0"><i>There is no music in the life</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>That sounds with idiot laughter solely;</i></p>

</div>
<p>No one has treated the passion of love more purely. Love with
the modern French composer is too often merely a pronounced
phase of eroticism, or it is purely, or impurely, cerebral. With
Wagner it is as a rule heroically sensuous if not sensual. Is there
one page of Schubert&rsquo;s music that is characterized first of all by
sensuousness? A few measures are played or sung; the music may
be unknown to the hearer, but he says to himself &ldquo;Schubert,&rdquo; and
not merely because he recognizes restless changes from major to
minor and from minor to major, tremulous tonalities, surprising
ease in modulation, na&iuml;ve, direct melody. The sedulous ape may
sweat in vain; there is no thought of Schubert, whose mannerisms
are his whole individuality.</p>
<p>This individuality defies analysis. It was finely said by Walt
Whitman that all music is &ldquo;what awakens from you when you
are reminded by the instruments&rdquo;; the hearer&rsquo;s thoughts are
sweeter and purer, his soul is cheered or soothed, when he is
reminded by the music of Schubert.</p>
<p>Pompous eulogies have been paid this homely, human, inspired
man, who knew poverty and distress, who was ignored by the
mob while he lived his short life, who never heard some of his
most important works, whose works were scattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schubert, turning round, clutched at the wall with his poor,
tired hands, and said in a slow voice, &lsquo;Here, here is my end.&rsquo;
At three in the afternoon of Wednesday, November 19, 1828, he
breathed his last, and his simple, earnest soul took its flight from
the world. There never has been one like him, and there will never
be another.&rdquo; When you read these words of Sir George Grove,
something chokes you; they outweigh the purple phrases and
dexterously juggled sentences of the rhetorician.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful that Schubert never finished the work. Possibly
the lost arms of the Venus of Milo might disappoint if they
were found and restored. The few measures of the <i>scherzo</i> that
are in the manuscript furnish but slight hope that here at last
Schubert would not, as in so many of his works of long breath,
maintain a steady <i>decrescendo</i> of interest.</p>
<p class="tb">Surely, no one would deny the melancholy beauty of the first
movement of Schubert&rsquo;s symphony, with its lyricism that is appealingly
feminine, with its melancholy that is without touch of
peevishness and without taint of pessimism; and the second movement
has the serenity&mdash;that is, Schubert&rsquo;s romantic serenity, which
is another thing than the classic serenity of Mozart.</p>
<p class="tb">The symphony is eminently Schubertian in its beauty and in
its weakness. In the first movement there are measures of a
grandeur that is seldom found in Schubert&rsquo;s compositions. In
these measures we recognize the Schubert that conceived the
&ldquo;Doppelg&auml;nger,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Gruppe aus dem Tartarus,&rdquo; and a few other
songs in which dramatic force comes before charming lyricism.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Two brothers, Anselm and Joseph H&uuml;ttenbrenner, were fond of
Schubert. Their home was in Graz, Styria, but they were living at
Vienna. Anselm was a musician; Joseph was in a government office.
Anselm took Schubert to call on Beethoven, and there is a story that
the sick man said, &ldquo;You, Anselm, have my mind; but Franz has my
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
soul.&rdquo; Anselm closed the eyes of Beethoven in death. These brothers
were constant in endeavor to make Schubert known. Anselm went so
far as to publish a set of <i>Erlking Waltzes</i>, and assisted in putting
Schubert&rsquo;s opera, <i>Alfonso and Estrella</i> (1822), in rehearsal at Graz,
where it would have been performed if the score had not been too
difficult for the orchestra. In 1822 Schubert was elected an honorary
member of musical societies of Linz and Graz. In return for the compliment
from Graz, he began the Symphony in B minor, No. 8
(October 30, 1822). He finished the <i>allegro</i> and the <i>andante</i>, and he
wrote nine measures of the <i>scherzo</i>. Schubert visited Graz in 1827,
but neither there nor elsewhere did he ever hear his unfinished work.</p>
<p>Anselm H&uuml;ttenbrenner went back to his home about 1820. It was
during a visit to Vienna that he saw Beethoven dying. Joseph remained
at Vienna. In 1860 he wrote from the office of the Minister of the
Interior a singular letter to Johann Herbeck, who then conducted the
concerts of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. He begged permission
to sing in concerts as a member of the society, and urged him to look
over symphonies, overtures, songs, quartets, choruses by Anselm. He
added towards the end of the letter, &ldquo;He [Anselm] has a treasure in
Schubert&rsquo;s B minor symphony, which we put on a level with the great
Symphony in C, his instrumental swan song, and any one of the symphonies
by Beethoven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herbeck was inactive and silent for five years, although he visited
Graz several times. Perhaps he was afraid that if the manuscript came
to light he could not gain possession of it, and the symphony, like the
one in C, would be produced elsewhere than in Vienna. Perhaps he
thought the price of producing one of Anselm H&uuml;ttenbrenner&rsquo;s works
in Vienna too dear. There is reason to believe that Joseph insisted on
this condition.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>In 1865 Herbeck was obliged to journey with his sister-in-law, who
sought health. They stopped in Graz. On May 1 he went to Ober-Andritz,
where the old and tired Anselm, in a hidden little one-story
cottage, was awaiting death. Herbeck sat down in a humble inn. He
talked with the landlord, who told him that Anselm was in the habit
of breakfasting there. While they were talking, Anselm appeared.
After a few words, Herbeck said, &ldquo;I am here to ask permission to produce
one of your works at Vienna.&rdquo; The old man brightened, he shed
his indifference, and after breakfast took him to his home. The work-room
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
was stuffed with yellow and dusty papers, all in confusion.
Anselm showed his own manuscripts, and finally Herbeck chose one
of the ten overtures for performance. &ldquo;It is my purpose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
bring forward three contemporaries, Schubert, H&uuml;ttenbrenner, and
Lachner, in one concert before the Viennese public. It would naturally
be very appropriate to represent Schubert by a new work.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I have
still a lot of things by Schubert,&rdquo; answered the old man; and he pulled
a mass of papers out of an old-fashioned chest. Herbeck immediately
saw on the cover of a manuscript &ldquo;<i>Symphonie in H moll</i>,&rdquo; in Schubert&rsquo;s
handwriting. Herbeck looked the symphony over. &ldquo;This would
do. Will you let me have it copied immediately at my cost?&rdquo; &ldquo;There
is no hurry,&rdquo; answered Anselm. &ldquo;Take it with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony was first played at a Gesellschaft concert, Vienna,
December 17, 1865, under Herbeck&rsquo;s direction. It was played at the
Crystal Palace, Sydenham, in 1867.</p>

<p>There are some who are not persuaded by Schumann and Weingartner
into enjoying the extreme length of the symphony. They
would fain have the work undergo some process of condensation,
and yet it would be difficult for them to indicate the measures
or sections that should be omitted.</p>
<p>It is still a marvelous work in certain respects. The Hungarian
dash in the second theme of the first movement; the wonderful
trombone passage; the melodic charm of the <i>andante</i> and the
infinite beauty of the detail&mdash;but when one begins to speak of this
movement he might vie with Schubert in length; the expressive
trio of the <i>scherzo</i>; the rush of the <i>finale</i>&mdash;these place the symphony
high on the list; and yet, and yet&mdash;but Schubert was not
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
a severe critic of his own compositions. He wrote at full speed,
and he had not the time to revise, to condense.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The manuscript of this symphony, numbered 7 in the Breitkopf
&amp; H&auml;rtel list and sometimes known as No. 10, bears the date March,
1828. In 1828 Schubert composed besides this symphony the songs
&ldquo;Die Sterne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Der Winterabend&rdquo;; the oratorio, <i>Mirims Siegesgesang</i>;
the song &ldquo;Auf dem Strom&rdquo;; the <i>Schwanengesang</i> cycle; the
string quintet, Op. 163, and the Mass in E flat. On November 14 he
took to his bed. It is said that Schubert gave the work to the Musikverein
of Vienna for performance; that the parts were distributed; that
it was even tried in rehearsal; that its length and difficulty were against
it, and it was withdrawn on Schubert&rsquo;s own advice in favor of his
earlier Symphony in C, No. 6 (written in 1817). All this has been
doubted; but the symphony is entered in the catalogue of the society
under the year 1828, and the statements just quoted have been fully
substantiated. Schubert said, when he gave the work to the Musikverein,
that he was through with songs and should henceforth confine
himself to opera and symphony.</p>
<p>It has been said that the first performance of the symphony was at
Leipsic in 1839. This statement is not true. Schubert himself never
heard the work; but it was performed at a concert of the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde, Vienna, December 14, 1828, and repeated March
12, 1829. It was then forgotten until Schumann visited Vienna in 1838
and looked over the mass of manuscripts then in the possession of
Schubert&rsquo;s brother Ferdinand. Schumann sent a transcript of the symphony
to Mendelssohn for the Gewandhaus concerts, Leipsic. It was
produced at the concert of March 21, 1839, under Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
direction, and repeated three times during the following season&mdash;December
12, 1839, March 12 and April 3, 1840. Mendelssohn made
some cuts in the work for these performances. The score and parts
were published in January, 1850.</p>
<p>The manuscript is full of alterations. As a rule Schubert made few
changes or corrections in his score. In this symphony, alterations are
found at the very beginning. The subject of the introduction and that
of the <i>allegro</i> were materially changed; the tempo of the opening
movement was altered from <i>allegro vivace</i> to <i>allegro ma non troppo</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
Only the <i>finale</i> seems to have satisfied him as originally conceived, and
this <i>finale</i> is written as though at headlong speed.</p>
<p>The symphony<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones, kettledrums,
strings. There is a story that Schubert was afraid he had made too free
use of trombones and asked advice of Franz Lachner.</p>
<p>The second theme of the first movement has a decidedly Slav-Hungarian
character, and this character colors other portions of the
symphony both in melody and general mood. The rhythm of the
<i>scherzo</i> theme had been used by Schubert as early as 1814 in his
Quartet in B flat. It may also be remarked that the <i>scherzo</i> is not
based on the old minuet form, and that there is more thematic development
than was customary in such movements at that period.</p>
<p>There is a curious tradition&mdash;a foolish invention is perhaps the better
phrase&mdash;that the <i>finale</i> illustrates the story of Pha&euml;ton and his justly
celebrated experience as driver of Apollo&rsquo;s chariot. Others find in the
<i>finale</i> a reminiscence of the terrible approach of the Statue towards
the supper table of Don Giovanni.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">SCHUMANN</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Zwickau, Saxony, June 8, 1810; died at Endenich, near Bonn, July 29, 1856)</p>
<p>It has been urged against Schumann that his symphonies were
thought for the pianoforte and then orchestrated crudely, as by
an amateur. This, however, is not the fatal objection. He had his
own orchestral speech. Good, bad, or indifferent, it was his own.
He could not have otherwise expressed himself through the orchestral
instruments. His speech is to be accepted or rejected as
the hearer is impressed chiefly by ideas, or by the manner of
expression.</p>
<p>A more serious objection is this: the genius of Schumann was
purely lyrical, although occasionally there is the impressive expression
of a wild or melancholy mood, as in the chords of unearthly
beauty soon after the beginning of the overture to <i>Manfred</i>.
Whether the music be symphonic, chamber, a pianoforte piece or
a song, the beauty, the expressive force lies in the lyric passages.
When Schumann endeavored to build a musical monument, to
quote Vincent d&rsquo;Indy&rsquo;s phrase, he failed; for he had not architectonic
imagination or skill.</p>
<p>His themes in symphonies, charming as they often are, give one
the impression of fragments, of music heard in sleep-chasings.
Never a master of contrapuntal technique, he repeated these
phrases over and over again instead of broadly developing them,
and his filling in is generally amateurish and perfunctory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>The best of Schumann&rsquo;s music is an expression of states and
conditions of soul. This music is never spectacular; it is never
objective. Take, for instance, his music to Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. The
episodes that attracted the attention of Berlioz, Liszt, Gounod,
were not to Schumann a source of inspiration. It was the mysticism
in the poem that led him to musical interpretation. His music,
whether for voice or instruments, is first of all <i>innig</i>, and this
German word is not easily translated into English. Heartfelt, deep,
ardent, fervent, intimate; no one of these words conveys exactly
the idea contained in <i>innig</i>. There is the intimacy of personal and
shy confession.</p>
<p>Schumann in his life was a reticent man. He dreamed dreams.
He was lost in thought when others, in the beerhouse or at his
home, were chattering about art. He put into his music what he
would with difficulty have said aloud to his Clara. As a critic he
was bold in praise and blame. As a composer he was often not
assertive as one on a platform. He told his dreams, he wove his
romantic fabric for a few sympathetic souls. It is true that in his
days of wooing he was orchestrally jubilant, as in the first movement
of the Symphony in B flat, but in this movement the anticipation
aroused by the first measures is not realized. The thoughts
soared above the control of the thinker; there was not the mastery
over them that allowed no waste material, that gives golden expression
without alloy.</p>
<p>In his own field, Schumann is lonely, incomparable. No composer
has whispered such secrets of subtle and ravishing beauty
to a receptive listener. The hearer of Schumann&rsquo;s music must in
turn be imaginative and a dreamer. He must often anticipate the
composer&rsquo;s thought. This music is not for a garish concert hall;
it shrinks from boisterous applause.</p>

<p>The opening is imposing with need of re-orchestration. Charming
is the lyric passage in the <i>scherzo</i> that puts one in mind of
Schubert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hark, Hark, the Lark&rdquo;; but for the most part there
is rhythmic uniformity and boresome repetition that no change in
the instrumentation could redeem. As the thick orchestration
stands, if the music is played according to Schumann&rsquo;s directions,
Weingartner says, it is impossible to produce a true <i>forte</i> or an
expressive <i>pianissimo</i>.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Schumann was married to Clara Wieck, September 12, 1840, after
doubts, anxieties, and opposition on the part of her father; after a
nervous strain of three or four years. His happiness was great, but to
say with some that this joy was the direct inspiration of the First
symphony would be to go against the direct evidence submitted by the
composer. He wrote Ferdinand Wenzel: &ldquo;It is not possible for me to
think of the journal&rdquo; (the <i>Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik</i>, founded by
Schumann, Wieck, Schunke, and Knorr in 1834, and edited in 1841 by
Schumann alone). &ldquo;I have during the last days finished a task (at
least in sketches) which filled me with happiness, and almost exhausted
me. Think of it, a whole symphony&mdash;and, what is more, a Spring symphony;
I myself can hardly believe that it is finished.&rdquo; And he said in a
letter (November 23, 1842) to Spohr: &ldquo;I wrote the symphony toward
the end of the winter of 1841, and, if I may say so, in the vernal
passion that sways men until they are very old, and surprises them
again with each year. I do not wish to portray, to paint; but I believe
firmly that the period in which the symphony was produced influenced
its form and character, and shaped it as it is.&rdquo; He wrote to Wilhelm
Taubert, who was to conduct the work in Berlin: &ldquo;Could you infuse
into your orchestra in the performance a sort of longing for the Spring,
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
which I had chiefly in mind when I wrote in February, 1841? The
first entrance of trumpets, this I should like to have sounded as though
it were from high above, like unto a call to awakening; and then I
should like reading between the lines, in the rest of the introduction,
how everywhere it begins to grow green, how a butterfly takes wing;
and, in the <i>allegro</i>, how little by little all things come, that in any way
belong to Spring. True, these are fantastic thoughts, which came to me
after my work was finished; only I tell you this about the <i>finale</i>, that I
thought it as the good-bye of Spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(It may here be noted that the symphony was fully sketched in four
days, and that Schumann now speaks of composing the work in
February, 1841, and now of writing it towards the end of that year.)</p>
<p>Berthold Litzmann, in the second volume of his <i>Clara Schumann</i>
(Leipsic, 1906), gives interesting extracts from the common diary of
Schumann and his wife, notes written while Schumann was composing
this symphony.</p>
<p>Towards the end of December, 1840, she complained that Robert
had been for some days &ldquo;very cold toward her, yet the reason for it
is a delightful one.&rdquo; On January 17-23, 1841, she wrote that it was
not her week to keep the diary, &ldquo;but, if a man is composing a symphony,
it is not to be expected that he will do anything else....
The symphony is nearly finished. I have not yet heard a note of it, but I
am exceedingly glad that Robert at last has started out in the field
where, on account of his great imagination, he belongs.&rdquo; January 25:
&ldquo;Today, Monday, Robert has nearly finished his symphony; it was
composed chiefly at night&mdash;for some nights my poor Robert has not
slept on account of it. He calls it &lsquo;Spring symphony.&rsquo;... A spring
poem by [Boettger] gave him the first impulse toward composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the diary Schumann completed the symphony on Tuesday,
January 26. &ldquo;Begun and finished in four days.... If there were
only an orchestra for it right away. I must confess, my dear husband,
I did not give you credit for such dexterity.&rdquo; Schumann began to work
on the instrumentation January 27; Clara impatiently waited to hear a
note of the symphony. The instrumentation of the first movement was
completed February 4, that of the second and third movements on
February 13, that of the fourth on February 20, in the year 1841. Not
till February 14 did Schumann play the symphony to her. E. F. Wenzel,
later a teacher at the Leipsic Conservatory, and E. Pfundt, a kettledrum
player of the Gewandhaus orchestra, were present. &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; she
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
wrote in her diary, &ldquo;to say a little something about the symphony, yet
I should not be able to speak of the little buds, the perfume of the
violets, the fresh green leaves, the birds in the air.... Do not laugh
at me, my dear husband! If I cannot express myself poetically, nevertheless
the poetic breath of this work has stirred my very soul.&rdquo; The
instrumentation was completed on February 20.</p>
<p>Clara wrote to Emilie Liszt after the performance: &ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s
symphony achieved a triumph over all cabals and intrigues.... I
never heard a symphony received with such applause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert wrote in the diary some days before that his next symphony
should be entitled &ldquo;Clara; and I shall paint her therein with flutes,
oboes, and harps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement opens with an introduction, <i>andante un poco
maestoso</i>, B flat major, 4-4, which begins with a virile phrase in the
horns and trumpets, answered by the full orchestra <i>fortissimo</i>. There
are stormy accents in the basses, with full chords in the brass and
other strings, and each chord is echoed by the wood-wind. Flute and
clarinet notes over a figure in the violas lead to a gradual <i>crescendo
ed accelerando</i>, which introduces the <i>allegro molto vivace</i>, B flat
major, 2-4. This begins at once with a brilliant first theme. The chief
figure is taken from the initial horn and trumpet call as Schumann
originally wrote it. The development of the theme leads finally to a
modulation to the key of C major, and there is the thought, naturally,
of F major as the tonality of the second theme, but this motive given
out by the clarinets and bassoons is in no definite tonality; it is in a
mode which suggests A minor and also D minor; the second section
ends, however, in F major, and the further development adheres to
this key. The first part of the movement is repeated. The free fantasia
is long and elaborately worked out. The first movement does not return
in the shape it has at the beginning of the <i>allegro</i>, but in the broader
version heard at the opening of the introduction. The long <i>coda</i> begins
<i>animato, poco a poco stringendo</i>, on a new theme in full harmony
in the strings, and it is developed until horns and trumpets sound the
familiar call.</p>
<p>The second movement, <i>larghetto</i>, E flat major, 3-8, opens with a
<i>romanza</i> developed by the violins. The second theme, C major, is of a
more restless nature, and its phrases are given out alternately by the
wood-wind and violins. The melodious first theme is repeated, B flat
major, by the violoncellos against an accompaniment in second violins
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
and violas and syncopated chords in the first violins and the wood-wind.
There is a new episodic theme. The first motive appears for the
third time, now in E flat major. It is sung by the oboe and horn, accompanied
by clarinets and bassoons, with passages in the strings. Near
the close of the short <i>coda</i> are solemn harmonies in bassoons and
trombones. This movement is enchained with the <i>scherzo</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>scherzo, molto vivace</i>, D minor, 3-4, begins in G minor. The
first trio, <i>molto pi&ugrave; vivace</i>, D major, 2-4, includes harmonic interplay
between strings and wind instruments. It is developed at some length,
and the <i>scherzo</i> is repeated. There is a second trio, B flat major, 3-4,
with imitative contrapuntal work, and it is followed by a second repetition
of the <i>scherzo</i>. A short <i>coda</i> has the rhythm of the first trio and
brings the end.</p>
<p><i>Finale</i>: <i>allegro animato e grazioso</i>, B flat major, 2-2. It begins with
a <i>fortissimo</i> figure which is used hereafter. The first theme, a cheerful,
tripping dance melody, enters and is developed by strings and wood-wind.
The second theme, equally blithe, is in G major, and the impressive
initial figure of the full orchestra at the beginning of the
movement, now given out by the strings, is in the second phrase. The
two motives are worked up alternately. The free fantasia opens quietly.
Trombones sound the rhythm of the first theme of the first movement.
There is a long series of imitations on the first theme of the <i>finale</i>.
This series leads to some horn calls and a <i>cadenza</i> for the flute. The
third section of the movement is regular, and there is a brilliant <i>coda</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the introduction to the first movement
and the <i>adagio</i>, in which the romantic dreamer Schumann is
revealed, the symphony has aged. And in this symphony, more
than the other three, the orchestration seems hopelessly crude,
ineffective, distressing to the ear, while the musical contents are
seldom worthy of a more tasteful dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>Yet there are few <i>adagios</i> to be compared with this dramatic
song of Schumann. If he had only had the courage to cut out
that meaningless and incongruous little episode, too deliberately
contrapuntal.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>In October, 1844, Schumann left Leipsic, where he had lived for
about fourteen years. He had in July given up the editorship of the
<i>Neue Zeitschrift</i>; he had been a teacher of pianoforte playing and
composition at the Leipsic Conservatory from April, 1843. A singularly
reserved man, hardly fitted for the duties of a teacher and without
pupils, he was in a highly nervous state, so that a physician recommended
a change of scene and told him he should not hear too much
music. Schumann therefore moved back to Dresden. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he wrote
in 1844, &ldquo;one can recover the old lost longing for music, there is so
little to hear. This suits my condition, for I still suffer very much from
my nerves, and everything affects and exhausts me immediately.&rdquo; He
saw few people; he talked little. In the early &rsquo;eighties they still showed
in Dresden a restaurant frequented by him, where, seated in a room
with his head against a wall, he would sit for hours at a time, dreaming
daydreams. In 1846 he was very sick, mentally and bodily. &ldquo;He observed
that he was unable to remember the melodies that occurred
to him when he was composing; the effort of invention fatigued his
mind to such an extent that it impaired his memory.&rdquo; When he did
work, he applied himself to contrapuntal problems.</p>
<p>The Symphony in C major, known as No. 2, but really the third&mdash;for
the one in D minor, written first, was withdrawn after performance,
remodeled, and finally published as No. 4&mdash;was composed in the
years 1845 and 1846. The symphony was published, score and parts,
in November, 1847. The symphony was first played at the Gewandhaus,
Leipsic, under Mendelssohn&rsquo;s direction, on November 5, 1846.</p>
<p>Schumann wrote from Dresden on April 2, 1849, to Otten, a writer
and conductor at Hamburg, who had brought about the performance
of the symphony in that city: &ldquo;I wrote the symphony in December,
1845, when I was still half sick. It seems to me one must hear this in
the music. In the <i>finale</i> I first began to feel myself; and indeed I was
much better after I had finished the work. Yet, as I have said, it recalls
to me a dark period of my life. That, in spite of all, such tones of
pain can awaken interest, shows me your sympathetic interest. Everything
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
you say about the work also shows me how thoroughly you
know music; and that my melancholy bassoon in the <i>adagio</i>, which
I introduced in that spot with especial fondness, has not escaped your
notice, gives me the greatest pleasure.&rdquo; In the same letter he expressed
the opinion that Bach&rsquo;s Passion according to John was a more powerful
and poetic work than his Passion according to Matthew.</p>
<p>And yet, when Jean J. H. Verhulst of The Hague (1816-91) visited
Schumann in 1845 and asked him what he had written that was new
and beautiful, Schumann answered he had just finished a new symphony.
Verhulst asked him if he thought he had fully succeeded.
Schumann then said, &ldquo;Yes, indeed, I think it&rsquo;s a regular Jupiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">There is a dominating motive, or motto, which appears more or
less prominently in three of the movements. This motto is proclaimed
at the very beginning, <i>sostenuto assai</i>, 6-4, by horns, trumpets, alto
trombone, <i>pianissimo</i>, against flowing counterpoint in the strings. This
motto is heard again in the <i>finale</i> of the following <i>allegro</i>, near the
end of the <i>scherzo</i>, and in the concluding section of the <i>finale</i>. (It
may also be said here that relationship of the several movements is
further founded by a later use of other fragments of the introduction
and by the appearance of the theme of the <i>adagio</i> in the <i>finale</i>.) This
motto is not developed: its appearance is episodic. It is said by one of
Schumann&rsquo;s biographers that the introduction was composed before
the symphony was written, and that it was originally designed for
another work. The string figure is soon given to the wood-wind
instruments. There is a <i>crescendo</i> of emotion and an acceleration of
the pace until a <i>cadenza</i> for the first violins brings in the <i>allegro, ma
non troppo</i>, 3-4. The first theme of this <i>allegro</i> is exposed frankly
and <i>piano</i> by full orchestra with the exception of trumpets and trombones.
The rhythm is nervous, and accentuation gives the idea of constant
syncopation. The second theme, if it may be called a theme, is
not long in entering. The exposition of this movement, in fact, is
uncommonly short. Then follows a long and elaborate development.
In the climax the motto is sounded by the trumpets.</p>
<p>The <i>scherzo, allegro vivace</i>, C major, 2-4, has two trios. The <i>scherzo</i>
proper consists of first violin figures in sixteenth notes, rather simply
accompanied. The first trio, in G major, 2-4, is in marked contrast.
The first theme, in lively triplet rhythm, is given chiefly to wood-wind
and horns; it alternates with a quieter, flowing phrase for strings. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
trio is followed by a return of the <i>scherzo</i>. The second trio, in A minor,
2-4, is calm and melodious. The simple theme is sung at first in full
harmony by strings (without double basses) and then developed against
a running contrapuntal figure. The <i>scherzo</i> is repeated, and, towards
the close, trumpets and horns loudly sound the motto.</p>
<p>The third movement, <i>adagio espressivo</i>, 2-4, is the development of
an extended <i>cantilena</i> that begins in C minor and ends in E flat major.
Violins first sing it; then the oboe takes it, and the song is more and
more passionate in melancholy until it ends in the wood-wind against
violin trills. This is followed by a contrapuntal episode, which to some
is incongruous in this extremely romantic movement. The melodic
development returns, and ends in C major.</p>
<p>The <i>finale, allegro molto vivace</i>, C major, 2-2, opens after two or
three measures of prelude with the first theme of vigorous character
(full orchestra except trombones). This is lustily developed until it
reaches a transitional passage, in which the violins have prominent
figures. All this is in <i>rondo</i> form. The second theme is scored for
violas, violoncellos, clarinets, and bassoons, while violins accompany
with the figures mentioned. This theme recalls the opening song of
the <i>adagio</i>. A new theme, formed from development of the recollection,
long hinted at, finally appears in the wood-wind and is itself
developed into a <i>coda</i> of extraordinary length. Figures from the first
theme of the <i>finale</i> are occasionally heard, but the theme itself does
not appear in the <i>coda</i>, although there is a reminiscence of a portion
of the first theme of the first movement. The motto is sounded by the
brass. There is a second exultant climax, in which the introductory
motive is of great importance.</p>

<p>This music has not the buoyancy and exciting rush of the First
symphony, or the romantic spirit of the one in D minor. Nor are
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
there pages equal in sheer beauty to those of the <i>adagio</i> in the
Second symphony. One wishes that the first movement was not in
so continuously heroic, exultant vein; that there was at least a
breathing spell. The second movement expresses a sort of clumsy
joviality. The third might be a pretty piano piece that had been
orchestrated. The fourth movement, the &ldquo;cathedral scene,&rdquo; is the
most impressive portion of the symphony. Here we have lofty
ideas and a solemn, ecstatical mood befitting a gorgeous ceremony
of the holy church.</p>
<p class="tb">Schumann&rsquo;s symphony was intended by him to be a glorification
of Rhenish scenes and Rhenish life. It was composed first of
all for D&uuml;sseldorf, the city where he met with many disappointments,
many vexations. He was temperamentally unfitted for the
position of city conductor. He did not have a firm control over the
players&mdash;in a word he was a composer&mdash;a man of dreams and
visions&mdash;not an interpreter of works by others, not even of his
own works. It was received coldly when it was first heard. The
compositions that followed showed his failing powers. There were
intrigues that vexed him. Little by little his mind gave way.
There was the attempt at suicide; then madness. But the Schumann
of this symphony was still the composer to be reckoned with.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The symphony was sketched and orchestrated at D&uuml;sseldorf between
November 2 and December 9, 1850. Clara Schumann wrote in her
diary, November 16, 1850: &ldquo;Robert is now at work on something, I
do not know what; for he has said nothing to me about it.&rdquo; It was on
December 9 that he surprised her with the symphony. Sir George
Grove, for some reason or other, thought Schumann began to work
on it before he left Dresden to accept the position of City Conductor
at D&uuml;sseldorf; that he wished to compose an important work for production
at the Lower Rhine Festival.</p>
<p>The first performance of this symphony was in Geisler Hall, D&uuml;sseldorf,
at the sixth concert of Der Allgemeine Musikverein, February 6,
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
1851. Schumann conducted from manuscript. The reception was cold.
Mme Schumann wrote after the performance that the &ldquo;creative power
of Robert was again ever new in melody, harmony, and form.... I
cannot say which one of the five movements is my favorite. The fourth
is the one that at present is the least clear to me; that it is most artistically
made&mdash;that I hear&mdash;but I cannot follow it so well, while there is
scarcely a measure in the other movements that remains unclear to me;
and indeed to the layman is this symphony, especially in its second
and third movements, easily intelligible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schumann wrote (March 19, 1851) to the publisher, Simrock, at
Bonn: &ldquo;I should have been glad to see a greater work published here
on the Rhine, and I mean this symphony, which perhaps mirrors here
and there something of Rhenish life.&rdquo; It is known that the solemn
fourth movement was inspired by the recollection of the ceremony at
Cologne Cathedral at the installation of the Archbishop of Geissel as
Cardinal, at which Schumann was present (November 12, 1850).
Wasielewski quotes the composer as saying that his intention was to
portray in the symphony as a whole the joyful folk life along the
Rhine, &ldquo;and I think,&rdquo; said Schumann, &ldquo;I have succeeded.&rdquo; Yet he refrained
from writing even explanatory mottoes for the movements.
The fourth movement originally bore the inscription, &ldquo;In the character
of the accompaniment to a solemn ceremony&rdquo;; but Schumann struck
this out and said: &ldquo;One should not show his heart to people; for a
general impression of an art work is more effective; the hearers then,
at least, do not institute any absurd comparison.&rdquo; The symphony was
very dear to him. He wrote (July 1, 1851) to Carl Reinecke, who made
a four-handed arrangement at Schumann&rsquo;s wish and to his satisfaction:
&ldquo;It is always important that a work which cost so much time and labor
should be reproduced in the best possible manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first movement, <i>lebhaft</i> (lively, animated), E flat major, 3-4,
begins immediately with a strong theme, announced by full orchestra.
The basses take the theme, and violins play a contrasting theme, which
is of importance in the development. The complete statement is repeated;
and the second theme, which is of an elegiac nature, is introduced
by oboe and clarinet and answered by violins and wood-wind.
The key is G minor, with a subsequent modulation to B flat. The fresh
rhythm of the first theme returns. The second portion of the movement
begins with the second theme in the basses, and the two chief
themes are developed with more impartiality than in the first section,
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
where Schumann is loath to lose sight of the first and more heroic
motive. After he introduces towards the end of the development the
first theme in the prevailing tonality, so that the hearer anticipates the
beginning of the reprise, he makes unexpected modulations, and finally
the horns break out with the first theme in augmentation in E flat
major. Impressive passages in syncopation follow, and trumpets answer,
until in an ascending chromatic climax the orchestra with full force
rushes to the first theme. There is a short <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>The second movement is a <i>scherzo</i> in C major, <i>sehr m&auml;ssig</i> (very
moderately), in 3-4. William Foster Apthorp found the theme to be
&ldquo;a modified version of the so-called &lsquo;Rheinweinlied,&rsquo;&rdquo; and this theme
of &ldquo;a rather ponderous joviality&rdquo; well expresses &ldquo;the drinkers&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Uns ist
ganz cannibalisch wohl, als wie f&uuml;nf hundert S&auml;uen!</i>&rsquo; (As &rsquo;twere five
hundred hogs, we feel so cannibalic jolly!) in the scene in Auerbach&rsquo;s
cellar in Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>.&rdquo; This theme is given out by the violoncellos
and is followed by a livelier contrapuntal counter theme, which is developed
elaborately. In the trio horns and other wind instruments sing
a <i>cantilena</i> in A minor over a long organ-point on C. There is a pompous
repetition of the first and jovial theme in A major; and then the
other two themes are used in combination in their original form. Horns
are answered by strings and wood-wind, but the ending is quiet.</p>
<p>The third movement, <i>nicht schnell</i> (not fast), in A flat major, 4-4,
is really the slow movement of the symphony, the first theme, clarinets
and bassoons over a viola accompaniment, reminding some of Mendelssohn;
others of &ldquo;<i>Tu che a Dio spiegasti l&rsquo;ali</i>,&rdquo; in <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>.
The second theme is a tender melody, not unlike a refrain heard
now and then. On these themes the <i>romanza</i> is constructed.</p>
<p>The fourth movement, <i>feierlich</i>, E flat minor, 4-4, is often described
as the &ldquo;Cathedral scene.&rdquo; Three trombones are added. The chief motive
is a short figure rather than a theme, which is announced by trombones
and horns. This appears augmented, diminished, and afterwards in
3-2 and 4-2. There is a departure for a short time to B major, but the
tonality of E flat minor prevails to the end.</p>
<p><i>Finale</i>: <i>lebhaft</i>, E flat major, 2-2. This movement is said to portray
a Rhenish festival. The themes are of a gay character. Towards the
end the themes of the &ldquo;Cathedral scene&rdquo; are introduced, followed by
a brilliant <i>stretto</i>. The <i>finale</i> is lively and energetic. The music, as a
rule, the free development of thematic material of the same unvaried
character.</p>

<p>Weingartner regards the D minor symphony of Schumann as
inferior to the first and second of the same composer. I fail to
see why. Surely this symphony does not fall behind its companions;
it is the one of Schumann&rsquo;s four that can be heard with
full enjoyment. The middle movements breathe a romantic spirit
that Schumann himself never surpassed as expressions of gentle,
dreamy melancholy. I know of few more haunting pages in
orchestral music than those of the trio in the <i>scherzo</i>.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was composed in 1841, immediately after the Symphony
in B flat major, No. 1. According to the composer&rsquo;s notes it was
&ldquo;sketched at Leipsic in June, 1841, newly orchestrated at D&uuml;sseldorf
in 1851. The first performance of the original version was at the
Gewandhaus, Leipsic, under David&rsquo;s direction. December 6, 1841.&rdquo; Clara
Schumann wrote in her diary on May 31 of that year: &ldquo;Robert began
yesterday another symphony, which will be in one movement, and
yet contain an <i>adagio</i> and a <i>finale</i>. I have heard nothing about it,
yet I see Robert&rsquo;s bustle, and I hear the D minor sounding wildly
from a distance, so that I know in advance that another work will be
fashioned in the depths of his soul. Heaven is kindly disposed toward
us: Robert cannot be happier in the composition than I am when he
shows me such a work.&rdquo; A few days later she wrote: &ldquo;Robert composes
steadily; he has already completed three movements, and I hope the
symphony will be ready by his birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their first child, Marie, was born on September 1, 1841. On the
thirteenth of the month, his wife&rsquo;s birthday, Marie was baptized and
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
the mother received from her husband the D minor symphony: &ldquo;which
I have quietly finished,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Schumann was not satisfied with the symphony, and he did not
publish it. In December, 1851, he revised the manuscript. During the
years between 1841 and 1853 Schumann had composed and published
the Symphony in C (No. 2) and the Symphony in E flat (No. 3);
the one in D minor was published therefore as No. 4. In its first
form the one in D minor was entitled &ldquo;<i>Symphonische Phantasie</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony in the revised and present form was played for the
first time at the seventh concert of the Allgemeine Musikverein at
D&uuml;sseldorf on March 3, 1853, in Geisler Hall. Schumann conducted
from manuscript. At this concert selections from the Mass were performed
for the first time.</p>
<p>The concert master, Ruppert Becker, made these entries in his diary
concerning the rehearsals and the first performance of this symphony
in D&uuml;sseldorf:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuesday, evening of March 1. Rehearsal for 7th Concert. Symphony
by Schumann for the first time; a somewhat short but thoroughly
fresh and vital piece of music. Wednesday, 2. 9 o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
2 rehearsal for concert. Thursday, 3. 7th concert: Program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Schumann compositions these were new: Symphony D minor,
which he had already composed 12 years ago, but had left lying till
now. 2 excerpts from a Mass: both full of the most wonderful harmonies,
only possible with Schumann. I liked the symphony especially
on account of its swing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony was dedicated to Joseph Joachim. On the title-page
of the manuscript was this inscription: &ldquo;When the first tones of this
symphony were awakened, Joseph Joachim was still a little fellow;
since then the symphony and still more the boy have grown bigger,
wherefore I dedicate it to him, although only in private. D&uuml;sseldorf,
December 23, 1853. Robert Schumann.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parts were published in November, 1853. The score was published
the next month.</p>
<p>It was stated for many years that the only changes made by
Schumann in this symphony were in the matter of instrumentation,
especially in the wood-wind. Some time after the death of Schumann
the first manuscript passed into the possession of Johannes Brahms,
who finally allowed the score to be published, edited by Franz W&uuml;llner.
It was then found that the composer had made important alterations
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
in thematic development. He had cut out elaborate contrapuntal work
to gain a broader, simpler, more rhythmically effective treatment,
especially in the last movement. He had introduced the opening theme
of the first movement &ldquo;as a completion of the melody begun by the
three exclamatory chords which make the fundamental rhythm at the
beginning of the last movement.&rdquo; And, on the other hand, some
thought the instrumentation of the first version occasionally preferable
on account of clearness to that of the second.</p>
<p class="tb">It was Schumann&rsquo;s wish that the symphony should be played without
pauses between the movements. Mendelssohn expressed the same
wish for the performance of his &ldquo;<i>Scotch</i>&rdquo; symphony, which was produced
nearly four months after the first performance of this Symphony
in D minor.</p>
<p>The first movement begins with an introduction, <i>ziemlich langsam</i>
(<i>un poco lento</i>), D minor, 3-4. The first motive is used later in the
&ldquo;Romanze.&rdquo; The orchestra gives out an A which serves as background
for this motive in sixths in the second violins, violas, and bassoons.
This figure is worked up contrapuntally. A dominant organ-point
appears in the basses, over which the first violins play an ascending
figure; the time changes from 3-4 to 2-4.</p>
<p>The main body of this movement, <i>lebhaft</i> (<i>vivace</i>), in D minor, 2-4,
begins <i>forte</i> with the development of the violin figure just mentioned.
This theme prevails, so that in the first section there is no true second
theme. The characteristic trombone figure reminds one of a passage
in Schumann&rsquo;s piano Quartet in E flat, Op. 47. There is a heroic
figure in the wood-wind instruments. After the repetition comes a
long free fantasia. The true second theme, sung in F major by first
violins, appears. The development is now perfectly free. There is no
third part.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Romanze,&rdquo; <i>ziemlich langsam</i> (<i>un poco lento</i>), in D minor&mdash;or,
rather, A minor plagal&mdash;opens with a mournful melody said to be
familiar in Provence. Schumann intended originally to accompany the
song of oboe and first violoncellos with a guitar. This theme is followed
by the dreamy motive of the introduction. Then the first phrases
of the &ldquo;Romanze&rdquo; are sung again by oboe and violoncellos, and there
is a second return of the contrapuntal work&mdash;now in D major&mdash;with
embroidery by a solo violin. The chief theme brings the movement to
a close on the chord of A major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>The <i>scherzo, lebhaft</i> (<i>vivace</i>), in D minor, 3-4, presents the development
of a rising and falling scale-passage of a few notes. The trio, in
B flat major, is of a peculiar and beautiful rhythmic character. The
first beat of the phrase falls constantly on a rest in all the parts. The
melody is almost always in the wood-wind, and the first violins are
used in embroidery. The <i>scherzo</i> is repeated after the trio, which returns
once more as a sort of <i>coda</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>finale</i> begins with a short introduction, <i>langsam</i> (<i>lento</i>), in B
flat major, and it modulates to D minor, 4-4. The chief theme of the
first movement is worked up against a counter figure in the trombones
to a climax. The main body of the movement <i>lebhaft</i> (<i>vivace</i>),
in D major, 4-4, begins with the brilliant first theme, which has the
character of a march, and it is not unlike the theme of the first movement
with its two members transposed. The figure of the trombones
in the introduction enters. The <i>cantabile</i> second theme begins in B
minor, but it constantly modulates in the development. The free
fantasia begins in B minor, with a G (strings, bassoons, trombones),
which is answered by a curious ejaculation by the whole orchestra.
There is an elaborate contrapuntal working out of one of the figures
in the first theme. The third part of the movement begins irregularly
with the return of the second theme in F sharp minor. The second
theme enters in the tonic. The <i>coda</i> begins in the manner of the free
fantasia, but in E minor; but the ejaculations are now followed by
the exposition and development of a passionate fourth theme. There
is a free closing passage, <i>schneller</i> (<i>pi&ugrave; moto</i>), in D major, 2-2.</p>

<p>After Schumann heard for the first time Mendelssohn play his own
Concerto in G minor, he wrote that he would never dream of composing
a concerto in three movements, each one complete in itself.
It is said that he began to write a pianoforte concerto when he was
only seventeen and ignorant of musical form; that in 1836 he sketched
a concerto in F major when he was living at Heidelberg. In January,
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
1839, he wrote from Vienna to Clara Wieck, his betrothed: &ldquo;My concerto
is a compromise between a symphony, a concerto, and a huge
sonata. I see I cannot write a concerto for the virtuosos: I must plan
something else.&rdquo; The key was not mentioned.</p>
<p>The first movement of the Concerto in A minor was written at
Leipsic in the summer of 1841&mdash;it was begun in May. It was then
called &ldquo;<i>Phantasie</i>&rdquo; in A minor, and was not intended for the movement
of a concerto. It was played for the first time by Clara Schumann,
on August 13, 1841, at a private rehearsal in the Gewandhaus,
Leipsic. This rehearsal was for the changes made in Schumann&rsquo;s First
symphony. Schumann wished in 1843 or 1844 to publish the work as
an <i>allegro affettuoso</i>, also as <i>Concert Allegro</i>, for pianoforte with orchestral
accompaniment, &ldquo;Op. 48,&rdquo; but he could not find a publisher.
The <i>intermezzo</i> and <i>finale</i> were composed at Dresden, May-July, 1845.
Clara wrote in her diary on July 31, 1845: &ldquo;Robert has finished his
concerto and given it to the copyists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole concerto was played for the first time by Clara Schumann
at her concert, December 4, 1845, in the Hall of the H&ocirc;tel de Saxe,
Dresden, from manuscript. The second performance was at Leipsic,
January 1, 1846, when Clara Schumann was the pianist and Mendelssohn
conducted. Verhulst attended a rehearsal, and said that the
performance was rather poor; the passage in the <i>finale</i> with the
puzzling rhythms &ldquo;did not go at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegro affettuoso</i>, A minor, 4-4. After a short pianoforte prelude,
the first period of the first theme is announced by wind instruments.
The antithesis, which is almost an exact repetition of the thesis,
is for the pianoforte. The second theme is practically a new version
of the first and may be considered as a new development of it. The
free fantasia begins <i>andante espressivo</i>, A flat major, 6-4. The recapitulation
section is almost a repetition of the first. There is an elaborate
<i>cadenza</i> for the pianoforte before the <i>coda</i>, which is an <i>allegro molto</i>,
A minor, 2-4.</p>
<p>II. <i>Intermezzo</i>: <i>andante grazioso</i>, F major, 2-4. The movement is in
simple <i>romanza</i> form. Dialogue between solo instrument and orchestra;
then more emotional phrases for violoncellos, violins, etc. (accompanied
by pianoforte <i>arpeggios</i>). At the close there are hints at the first theme
of the first movement, which lead directly to the <i>finale</i>.</p>
<p>III. <i>Allegro vivace</i>, A major, 3-4. The movement is in sonata form.
The pianoforte gives out the chief theme. After a modulation to E
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
major, the second theme is for the pianoforte. This theme is distinguished
by constantly syncopated rhythm. A contrasting theme is
developed in florid fashion by the pianoforte. The free fantasia begins
with a short orchestral <i>fugato</i> on the first theme. The third part begins
irregularly in D major, with the first theme as an orchestral <i>tutti</i>.
There is a long <i>coda</i>.</p>

<p>In each of his four symphonies Schumann used two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, four horns (two horns sufficed for the Second symphony), two

used the same orchestration, with two horns, and omitting the trombones.&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<h2 id="c128"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;THE POEM OF ECSTASY&rdquo; (LE PO&Egrave;ME DE L&rsquo;EXTASE), OP. 54</span></h2>
<p>A singular and at times interesting composition. Victor Hugo
has said that agony when at its height is mute. Some, on hearing
Scriabin&rsquo;s score, have wished, no doubt, that this were true of
ecstasy. Is the music really ecstatic? There are anthropological
sociologists who find extreme voluptuousness in physical pain.
Mantegazza has a chapter on this subject, a chapter that is not
for the <i>jeune fille</i>. We are told that Scriabin in this music wished
to express the ecstasy of untrammeled action, the joy in creative
activity. Let the poem he wrote, and the title, be put aside; there
are fine and original passages in the composition, and there is
certainly untrammeled action. The themes themselves are not
important, not expressive, not significant enough to warrant the
extravagant development and the polyphonic complexity. There
is also irritating repetition.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Le Po&egrave;me de l&rsquo;Extase</i>&rdquo; was performed for the first time by the
Russian Symphony Society of New York in New York, December 10,
1908. Modeste Altschuler conducted. We were indebted to Mr. Altschuler
in 1910 for the following information about <i>The Poem of
Ecstasy</i>:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>&ldquo;While I was in Switzerland during the summer of 1907 at Scriabin&rsquo;s
villa, he was all taken up with the work, and I watched its progress
with keen interest. The composer of the <i>Po&egrave;me de l&rsquo;Extase</i> has sought
to express therein something of the emotional (and therefore musically
communicable) side of his philosophy of life. Scriabin is neither a
pantheist nor a theosophist, yet his creed includes ideas somewhat
related to each of these schools of thought. There are three divisions
in his poem: 1. His soul in the orgy of love; 2. The realization of a
fantastical dream; 3. The glory of his own art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Modeste Altschuler has interesting letters written by Scriabin
covering the period of his sojourn in the United States and Mr.
Altschuler&rsquo;s journey to Russia in 1907, the aim of which was to secure
a subsidy from the Russian government for the Russian Symphony
Orchestra in New York. Scriabin was very anxious to assist Mr.
Altschuler in his mission. The letters plainly indicate his anxiety.
Those letters will appear in Mr. Altschuler&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>, which a Russian
historian was taking down in November, 1930, when Mr. Altschuler
was conductor of the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>Scriabin wrote from Paris in the spring of 1907 that he had finished
The Poem of Ecstasy. The revised instrumentation now in use was
made that summer (1907) by the composer and Modeste Altschuler
together, in Switzerland, where they spent two weeks together.</p>
<p>It has been said that the subject of <i>Le Po&egrave;me de l&rsquo;Extase</i> begins
where that of <i>Le divin Po&egrave;me</i> leaves off. The three divisions of the
latter symphony, movements joined together without a pause, are
&ldquo;Luttes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Volupt&eacute;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jeu divin&rdquo; (creative force consciously exercised).</p>
<p><i>Le Po&egrave;me de l&rsquo;Extase</i> was completed in January, 1908, in Switzerland,
the month of the Fifth sonata, which, it is said, was written in
three or four days. It is scored for these instruments: piccolo, three
flutes, three oboes, English horn, three clarinets, bass clarinet, three
bassoons, double bassoon, eight horns, five trumpets, three trombones,
bass tuba, kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam-tam, bells,
deep chime in C, celesta, two harps, organ, and the usual strings.</p>
<p>Scriabin wrote a poem in Russian for this orchestral composition.
The poem was published at Geneva, Switzerland, 1906. Mr. Altschuler
kindly lent his copy of it. A literal translation into English was made
by Mrs. Lydia L. Pimenov-Noble of Boston expressly for the Boston
Symphony Programme Book of October 22, 1910. The poem is very
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
long, too long for reprinting. There are verses that recur like a refrain,
especially the first lines:</p>
<div class="verse">

<h2 id="c129"><span class="h2line1">JEAN JULIUS CHRISTIAN</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SIBELIUS</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Tavastehus, Finland, December 8, 1865)</p>
<p>Some, judging the music of Sibelius or rhapsodizing over it,
have laid great stress on the fact that Finland is a wild and desolate
country. They therefore argue that the music of Sibelius must be
bleak and grim. They are also convinced that Sibelius himself
must be a stern-visaged man, something of a Berserk, savage and
unapproachable, to write as he does. But travelers assure us that
in Finland there are smiling landscapes, and we know from
personal acquaintance that Mr. Sibelius, like Baptista Minola in
the comedy, is &ldquo;an affable and courteous gentleman.&rdquo; We doubt
if climatic conditions, the constitutional qualities or the passive
mood of a man necessarily affect his music. Beethoven was in
doleful dumps when he wrote one of his most cheerful symphonies.
We have heard music by contemporaneous Italian composers
that is more barbaric, gloomier than the great majority of
that by Scandinavian or Russian musicians.</p>
<h2 id="c130"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 1, IN E MINOR, OP. 39</span></h2>
<dl class="undent i"><dd><span class="cn">I. </span>Andante ma non troppo; allegro energico</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Andante ma non troppo lento</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Allegro</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">IV. </span>Finale (quasi una fantasia): andante; allegro molto</dd></dl>
<p>There is a marked difference between the mood and the orchestral
expression of this First symphony and those of the composer&rsquo;s
Fifth and Seventh. Sibelius was not young in years when
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
he wrote the First&mdash;he was thirty-four&mdash;but this symphony was
the work of one musically young. It is seldom that a first symphony
rests on firm foundations architectonically planned, logically continuous
in flow of musical thought, as is the First symphony of
Brahms, who had written much chamber music before he ventured
into the symphonic field.</p>
<p>The musical thoughts of a symphonic composer meditating his
first work of long breath are many; they are often yeasty in their
exuberance. There is not yet in the joy of composing the ability
to eliminate. There is so much to say; all of it is thought important,
essential.</p>
<p>Yet this exuberance when it expresses itself in a fantastical
manner is not displeasing. Better wild irregularity, barbaric force
than the smug aping of orthodox and approved predecessors. In
the first symphony he did not escape the influence of Tchaikovsky,
an influence shown particularly in the second movement. But the
voice of Sibelius himself speaks in no uncertain tones: a virile
voice that has new things to say; is not ashamed of screaming
outbursts, sudden contrasts; not a whining egoist, not a despairing
pessimist; a strong soul not disturbed by the sensuous charm of
woman.</p>
<p>And so this symphony is more than conventionally interesting.
It is dramatic, as if Sibelius had had a drama in his mind, perhaps
one of his own life. The music is free, outspoken. It is without
fear of the learned professor at the conservatory. One might say
of the symphony, one hears this music and is in the mighty
presence of a man.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The First symphony was composed in 1899 and published in 1902.
The first performance was at Helsingfors on April 26, 1899. The
symphony was played in Berlin at a concert of Finnish music, led by
Robert Kajanus, in July, 1900.</p>
<p>I. Introduction: <i>andante ma non troppo</i>, E minor, 2-2. Over a drum
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
roll that rises and falls in intensity a clarinet sings a mournful melody,
which is of much importance in the <i>finale</i> of the symphony.</p>
<p>The first violins, after the short introduction, give out the first
theme with imitative passages for violas and violoncellos, <i>allegro
energico</i>, E minor, 6-4. There are two subsidiary motives: one for
wind instruments, and one, derived from this last, for strings. A
<i>crescendo</i> leads to a climax, with the proclamation of the first chief
theme by full orchestra with a furious drum roll. The second and contrasting
chief motive is given to the flutes, <i>piano ma marcato</i>, against
tremulous violins and violas and delicate harp chords. The conclusion
of this theme is developed and given to the flutes with syncopated
rhythm for the strings. The pace is quickened, and there is a <i>crescendo</i>,
which ends in B minor. The free fantasia is of a passionate nature
with passages that suggest mystery; heavy chords for wind instruments
are bound together with chromatic figures for the strings; wood-wind
instruments shriek out cries with the interval of a fourth; cries that
are taken from one in the introduction; the final section of the second
theme is sung by two violins with strange figures for the strings,
<i>pianissimo</i>, and with rhythms taken from the second chief theme.
These rhythms in the course of a powerful <i>crescendo</i> dominate at last.
The first chief theme endeavors to assert itself, but it is lost in descending
chromatic figures. Again there is a <i>crescendo</i>, and the strings have
the second subsidiary theme, which is developed until the wild entrance
of the first chief motive. The orchestra rages until, after a
great outburst and with clash of cymbals, a diminuendo leads to
gentle echoes of the conclusion of the second theme. Now the second
theme tries to enter, but without the harp chords that first accompanied
it. Rhythms that are derived from it lead to defiant blasts of the brass
instruments. The movement ends in this mood.</p>
<p>II. <i>Andante, ma non troppo lento</i>, E flat major, 2-2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>adagio</i> (<i>andante</i>) is steeped in his proper pathos, the pathos
of brief, bland summers, of light that falls for a moment, gentle and
mellow, and then dies away. Something like a memory of a girl
sitting amid the simple flowers in the white Northern sunshine haunts
the last few measures.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>andante</i> is purest folk melody; and it is strange how we know
this, though we do not know the special tune.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>III. <i>Allegro</i>, C major, 3-4. The chief theme of the <i>scherzo</i> may be
said to have the characteristically national humor, which seems to
Southern nations wild and heavily fantastical. The second theme is of
a lighter and more graceful nature. The trio, E major, is of a somewhat
more tranquil nature.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale</i> (<i>quasi una fantasia</i>), E minor. The <i>finale</i> begins with the
melody of the introduction of the first movement. It is now of an
epic, tragic nature, and not merely melancholy. There are hints in the
lower strings at the chief theme, which at last appears, 2-4, in the
wood-wind. This theme has a continuation which later has much
importance. The prevailing mood of the <i>finale</i> is one of wild and passionate
restlessness, but the second chief theme, <i>andante assai</i>, is a
broad, dignified, melodious motive for violins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The substratum [of the symphony] is national; in fact, one may
say that if the principal subjects are predominantly Slavonic in character,
the subsidiary ones are often distinctly Finnish, and the atmosphere
of storm and conflict which pervades the entire work is largely
the outcome of a kind of revolt on the part of this thematic rank and
file against their lords and masters. In this way the symphony presents
a symbolical picture of Finnish insurrection against Russian tyranny
and oppression. Not that I would suggest for a moment that the
composer had any such purpose in mind while writing it, but there
would be nothing surprising if there were an unconscious correspondence
between the state of mind of the composer and the position
of his unhappy country at the time when the symphony was conceived,
at the very height of the Tsarist persecution. On the contrary, it would
be surprising if there were not.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Paul Rosenfeld, who writes about certain modern composers
as if he had summered and wintered with them and been
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
through them with a dark lantern, finds this symphony of a
&ldquo;pastoral&rdquo; nature, full of &ldquo;home sounds, of cattle.&rdquo; The music
reveals a &ldquo;pale, evanescent sunlight,&rdquo; and through the music
sounds &ldquo;the burden of a lowly tragedy.&rdquo; This is entertaining reading,
to be sure, but to be charged with these impressions Mr.
Rosenfeld must have heard a tea-table performance of the symphony.
There is almost continually the tragic note in the music,
but the tragedy is hardly &ldquo;lowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This music is extremely Northern, at times bleak and windswept.
Arresting and impressive music; and lo, suddenly Sibelius drops
into Tchaikovskian mood, and even speaks the self-torturing Russian&rsquo;s
speech. Yet Sibelius is generally in the foreground, and his
speech is generally his own. It is when he would touch the heart
of the public that Tchaikovsky pushes him aside. There is much
of interest in the symphony besides the peculiar esthetic and racial
quality: there are qualities of the orchestration that hold the
attention and excite admiration, as the long <i>pizzicato</i> figure for
the double basses.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, composed in 1901-02, was produced at Helsingfors,
March 8, 1902, at a concert given by the composer.</p>
<p>According to Georg Schneevoight, an intimate friend of Sibelius,
the composer&rsquo;s intention was to depict in the first movement the quiet,
pastoral life of the Finns undisturbed by thought of oppression. The
second movement is charged with patriotic feeling, but the thought of
a brutal rule over the people brings with it timidity of soul. The
third, in the nature of a <i>scherzo</i>, portrays the awakening of national
feeling, the desire to organize in defense of their rights, while in the
<i>finale</i> hope enters their breasts and there is comfort in the anticipated
coming of a deliverer.</p>
<p>I. <i>Allegretto</i>, D major, with various rhythms, that of 6-4 predominating.
The movement begins with an accompaniment figure for
strings, which reappears in the course of the development. The quaint
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
first theme is announced by oboes and clarinets. This theme is worked,
and secondary motives are introduced, to be used again later. A passage
for strings <i>pizzicato</i> leads to a theme given out by flutes, oboes, and
clarinets in octaves; bassoons and brass instruments sustain, and the
strings have the characteristic strumming heard at the beginning. After
the free fantasia a prolonged tremolo of strings leads to the recapitulation.
The quaint first theme appears again in the wood-wind, but the
accompaniment is more elaborate. The second theme is again announced
by wind instruments, and at the end there is the initial figure
of accompaniment.</p>
<p>II. <i>Tempo andante ma rubato</i>, D minor, 4-4, 3-8, 4-4. On a roll
of kettledrums, double basses begin <i>pizzicato</i>, a figure which is finally
taken up by violoncellos, and serves as an accompaniment for a mournful
theme sung by the bassoons in octaves. The movement becomes
more animated and more dramatic. After a climax <i>fortississimo, molto
largamente</i>, the second and expressive theme is sung by some of the
first violins, violas, violoncellos (F sharp major, <i>andante sostenuto</i>),
accompanied at first by strings and then by running passages in flutes
and bassoons. This theme, now in wood-wind instruments, is accompanied
by running passages for violins. The first theme returns in
F sharp minor, and is developed to another climax, after which the
second theme enters in D minor, and toward the close there are hints
at the first motive.</p>
<p>III. <i>Vivacissimo</i>, B flat major, 6-8. The movement begins with a
nimble theme for violins. There is a short development, and flute and
bassoon announce the second theme, against the rhythm of the first,
which returns against a <i>tremolo</i> of wood-wind instruments supported
by brass and kettledrums. <i>Lento e suave</i>, G flat major, 12-4. The oboe
has the theme over sustained chords for bassoons and horns. This
section, which serves here as a trio to a <i>scherzo</i>, is short. There is a
repetition, with changes of the opening section. The oboe sounds
again the theme of the trio, and there is a free transition to the <i>finale</i>
without any pause.</p>
<p>IV. <i>Finale</i>: <i>allegro moderato</i>, D major, 3-2. The movement is
fashioned after the general style of a <i>rondo</i> on a short and simple
theme announced immediately by violins, violas, and violoncellos.
There are less important motives which serve as thematic material,
and there are modifications of tonality and tempo. The movement
ends in a sonorous apotheosis, <i>molto largamente</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth symphony is strangely different in character from
those that precede and follow it. Was Sibelius experimenting, endeavoring
to strike out a new path? Was he dissatisfied with the
result? When it was performed in New York as a new piece, Mr.
Henderson, the most sympathetic of those reviewing the symphony,
thought that Sibelius had &ldquo;parted company with himself
and joined the futurists.&rdquo; One of the critics went so far as to
describe the work as &ldquo;inconsequential as the ravings of a drunken
man.&rdquo; This was an absurd opinion, for, whatever may be said of
the symphony, it is not &ldquo;inconsequential&rdquo;; it was planned deliberately;
one might say, from the lack of emotional quality, planned
in cold blood.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was an argument in his mind. Perhaps he had
been hearing <i>Parsifal</i>, for there are times in the symphony when
one is reminded of Amfortas with his complaining voice. Not that
Sibelius was obliged to borrow phrases; but the mood of the composer
and that of the wounded knight are at times alike. There is
also the suggestion of similar harmonic and orchestral, but not
melodic expression.</p>
<p>The thematic material is for the most part cool, contemplative,
often fragmentary, or purposely incomplete. The melancholy that
drips from the pages is almost without relief. Nor does one find
the symphony of &ldquo;baffling simplicity&rdquo; as a London reviewer found
it a few years ago. The &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; was carefully contrived. There
is little real beauty, frank or subtle&mdash;there is little that impresses
by loftiness of thought, or nobility of expression. There is prevailing
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
sobriety. Sibelius might say, &ldquo;That is the way I felt when I
wrote it. I could not write otherwise any more than I could then
feel differently.&rdquo; Is it not a significant fact that Sibelius soon left
this path that he had found?</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony, dated 1911, was performed at Helsingfors in that
year. The score is dedicated to Eero J&auml;rnefelt.</p>
<p>The reviewer for the London <i>Times</i> noted (February 28, 1921)
that there was moderate applause after a performance, and added:
&ldquo;After all, what was there to make a fuss about? No accumulation
of energy, no building to a climax, no display of rhetoric; just a
number of ideas, each dwelt on as long as it showed capacity for
growth, each left as soon as it had generated another; there is just
enough relevance to defeat the charge of inconsequence, not enough
arrangement to suggest a moment&rsquo;s tautology. The fineness of this
symphony is of the ascetic type which refuses the luxuries of sound
and finds a miracle in the simplest relations of notes. From these relations
the tunes grow naturally as folk tunes grow. From the intonation
of two notes at the outset comes the whole of the first movement; a
perfect fifth is the source of the most expansive melody which crowns
the third movement. There is nothing abstruse about it; people only
fail to understand it because they cannot believe that any man could
be so simple and so real as Sibelius shows himself to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox Strangways wrote (February 21, 1932): &ldquo;Sibelius has, what
only the best composers have, the flair for the phrase that will repay
investigation. His phrase on paper impresses no one; when you hear
it, spaced out, set in relief, debated upon, it grows life size. He seems
to go on for minutes together in an ordinary tone of voice, and then
suddenly an idea stings him, and he is afire, and the whole room
hanging on his lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The complete absence of sensuous appeal in this work,&rdquo; writes
Cecil Gray, &ldquo;coupled with the exacting demands it makes upon the
intelligence of audiences, will always prevent it from being popular.
For the few, however, it probably constitutes Sibelius&rsquo;s greatest achievement;
he has certainly never written anything to surpass it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">300</div>
<h2 id="c133"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 5, IN E FLAT MAJOR, OP. 82</span></h2>

<dd><span class="cn">II. </span>Andante mosso, quasi allegretto</dd>
<dd><span class="cn">III. </span>Allegro molto: un pochettino largamente</dd></dl>
<p>There is not a sensuous note, not a single bid for immediate
popularity; but there is something in the symphony that will be
permanent. It is skillfully constructed in a new manner; skillfully
scored with most ingenious effects not too laboriously contrived,
and with a comparatively small orchestra. The young composer of
today, looking at the score, will rub his eyes in wonder and exclaim:
&ldquo;What! No English horn, no bass clarinet, only four horns,
no celesta, xylophone, harp, tam-tam? What&rsquo;s the man thinking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sibelius has ideas. He feels deeply; he pours out his emotions;
he snaps his fingers at decorations, at sensational effects, at
sugared pages sure to please. When he is in lighter mood it is only
for a moment; the eternal questions asked since the beginning of
time are ever in his mind; yet serious, he is not dull, he does not
sermonize. He writes music first of all to free himself of what is in
his heart and brain and must out.</p>
<p>This man of the North knows the exciting effect of oriental
repetition in phrase and rhythm, and on these repetitions he rears
imposing musical structures. There are measures to which dervishes
might whirl, rays of the sun break through the clouds, yet we prefer
Sibelius when the sky is leaden.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was composed before the World War. It was performed
at Helsingfors as early as the spring of 1914. It is said that
the symphony was revised before performances in other cities, among
them Stockholm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
<p>The first two movements are here played as one.</p>
<p>When the symphony was performed in London the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
had this to say: &ldquo;It is true that this symphony is designed on broader
lines than its predecessor; it contains more positive statement of its
ideas, many of which are of the simplest melodic kind, that the coloring
is richer and fuller, with more use of the effects of orchestral
masses....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first two movements are closely linked together by a four-note
motto theme which pervades the greater part of the subject matter
of both; they are distinguished by contrast of mood. The first is a
dreaming fantasy in which many motives and forces contend; the
second unifies them in a more closely knit <i>scherzo</i> rhythm. Through
both of them the strings supply in an uneasy background of shimmering
sound, while the voices of the wind instruments are more closely
articulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third movement is <i>andante quasi allegretto</i>. The rather dry
rhythmic pattern of the chief theme is discussed among the instruments
in a way which is strangely Mozart-like, and marks more definitely
Sibelius&rsquo;s abstracted devotion to pure beauty of design. The <i>finale</i>
launches out into a franker expression of feeling. Its second subject
makes an almost passionate appeal on its first revival, and this appeal is
intensified in the long development of it which leads to the <i>coda</i>. Yet
somehow this ending left the feeling that the composer had not
allowed himself to say all that he meant, or the thing which he meant
most of all. This may have been partly in the playing, for Sibelius is a
difficult conductor to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sibelius, both as composer and conductor, stands apart, a lonely
figure seeking with difficulty to bring the ideals which are intensely
real to him into touch with other minds. Possibly it is his struggle
for expression which sometimes recalls Beethoven as one listens to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c134"><span class="h2line1">SYMPHONY NO. 7, OP. 105<br />(<i>In one movement</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Lawrence Gilman was right in characterizing Sibelius&rsquo; Seventh
symphony as &ldquo;enigmatic, puissant.&rdquo; Is it also, as he says,
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
&ldquo;strangely moving&rdquo;? It is not a symphony for an afternoon&rsquo;s careless
pleasure.</p>
<p>The music of Sibelius seldom accepts the canons of obvious
beauty. His musical soul is proud, regardless of popular applause.
In his latest works he seems to be writing for himself; to be
absorbed in introspection and the expression of what he finds
that is dear and important to himself alone. There are noble ideas,
fleeting and haunting passages, in this symphony, but the plan
and the conclusion of the whole are not easily grasped.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>It has been said that this symphony, published in 1925, was composed
with the view of producing it under the direction of the
composer at an English music festival. Sickness prevented his going
to England. The symphony was performed in Philadelphia by the
Philadelphia Orchestra, Mr. Stokowski conductor, on April 3, 1926.</p>
<p>There is no designation of key. The opening measures are in A
minor; the ending is in C major.</p>
<p>The first section is a somber <i>adagio</i>. It opens with an ascending
scale, 3-2 time for the strings. This is the basic theme of the symphony,
appearing as a whole, in fragments, or inverted. A lyric theme
follows, C major, for violas (divided) and violoncellos. The violins
join later. There is a melody, somewhat like a chant for a solo trombone.
This later assumes marked importance. The pace grows faster,
until it is <i>vivacissimo</i>, C minor. Mr. Gilman, in his lucid notes for the
Philadelphia Programme Book, finds that the subject now announced
by the strings &ldquo;recalls the mood of the <i>scherzo</i> of Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;<i>Eroica</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The <i>adagio</i> tempo recurs, as does the trombone theme, which the
brass section enlarges. Change in tempo: <i>allegro molto moderato</i>.
There is a new motive, C major, 6-4, simple, in folk manner; still
another motive with wood-wind &ldquo;doubled in pairs, playing in thirds,
fifths and sixths.&rdquo; The development is for strings and wind. <i>Vivace</i>,
E flat major. Antiphonal measures for strings and wood-wind. &ldquo;The
tempo becomes <i>presto</i>, the key C major. The strings, divided in eight
parts, begin a mysteriously portentous passage, at first <i>pianississimo</i>,
with the violas and violoncellos defining an urgent figure against a
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
reiterated pedal G of the violins, basses, and tympani. A <i>crescendo</i>,
<i>rallentando</i>, is accompanied by a fragment of the basic scale passage,
in augmentation, for the horns. The tempo is again <i>adagio</i>; and now
the chant-like C major theme is heard once more from the brass choir,
against mounting figurations of the strings. There is a climax <i>fortissimo</i>,
for the whole orchestra. The strings are heard alone, <i>largamente molto</i>,
in an <i>affettuoso</i> of intense expression. Flute and bassoon in octaves,
supported by soft string tremolos, sing a plaint. The strings, <i>dolce</i>, in
syncopated rhythm, modulate through seventh chords in A flat and G
to a powerful suspension, <i>fortissimo</i>, on the tonic chord of C major;
and this brings to a close the enigmatic, puissant, and strangely moving
work.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The instrumentation which Sibelius calls for in his Seventh symphony is typical
of the severely &ldquo;classical&rdquo; orchestration which was the basis of his symphonies in
general: two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three
trumpets, three trombones, kettledrums, and strings. This was also the instrumentation
of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth (although, for episodic purposes, a
glockenspiel was added to the Fourth, and a bass clarinet and harp to the Sixth).
The First symphony had a richer bass and percussion&mdash;bass tuba, bass drum,
cymbals, triangle, and harp were used (compare the orchestration of <i>Finlandia</i>
and <i>The Swan of Tuonela</i> of the same early period). When he wrote his Second
symphony, Sibelius dropped all these instruments of percussion. The tuba he kept
for the Second, but he did not use it again in his symphonies.&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<h2 id="c135"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;FINLANDIA,&rdquo; SYMPHONIC POEM FOR ORCHESTRA, OP. 26, NO. 7</span></h2>
<p>It is said that <i>Finlandia</i>, although it was composed as far back as
1894, evokes such enthusiasm in the composer&rsquo;s native land that
performance of it was forbidden by the oppressing Russian. The
question is, does <i>Finlandia</i> evoke enthusiasm in Madrid, Dresden,
Boston? For after all it is something more than a national document.
It is picturesque, with suggestions of prayers and hymns,
revolts and revolutions.</p>
<p class="tb">There is more of Finland in the symphonies, the violin concerto,
and <i>A Saga</i> of Sibelius than in his <i>Finlandia</i>, which is hot with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
spirit of revolt. No doubt he wrote this music with a patriotic heart,
but patriotism is not an essential quality in a musical work of art.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Finlandia: Tondight for orkester</i>, Op. 26, No. 7, was composed in
1894. It is not a fantasia on genuine folk tunes. The composer is the
authority for this statement. Mrs. Newmarch says: &ldquo;Like Glinka,
Sibelius avoids the crude material of the folk song; but like this great
national poet, he is so penetrated by the spirit of his race that he can
evolve a national melody calculated to deceive the elect. On this point
the composer is emphatic, &lsquo;There is a mistaken impression among the
press abroad,&rsquo; he has assured me, &lsquo;that my themes are often folk
melodies. So far I have never used a theme that was not of my own
invention. Thus the thematic material of <i>Finlandia</i> and <i>En Saga</i> is
entirely my own.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following note is from a programme of the Russian Symphony
Society:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Finlandia</i>, though without explanatory subtitle, seems to set forth
an impression of the national spirit and life.... The work records
the impressions of an exile&rsquo;s return home after a long absence. An agitated,
almost angry theme for the brass choir, short and trenchant, begins
the introduction, <i>andante sostenuto</i> (<i>alla breve</i>). This theme is
answered by an organ-like response in the wood-wind, and then a
prayerful passage for strings, as though to reveal the essential earnestness
and reasonableness of the Finnish people, even under the stress of
national sorrow. This leads to an <i>allegro moderato</i> episode, in which
the restless opening theme is proclaimed by the strings against a very
characteristic rhythmic figure, a succession of eight beats, the first
strongly accented.... With a change to <i>allegro</i> the movement,
looked at as an example of the sonata form, may be said to begin. A
broad, cheerful theme by the strings in A flat, against the persistent
rhythm in the brass, is followed by a second subject, introduced by
the wood-wind and taken up by the strings, then by the &rsquo;cello and
first violin. This is peaceful and elevated in character, and might be
looked upon as prophetic of ultimate rest and happiness. The development
of these musical ideas carries the tone poem to an eloquent conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Finlandia</i> is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums,
bass drum, cymbals, triangle and strings.</p>
<h2 id="c136"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;THE SWAN OF TUONELA&rdquo; (&ldquo;TUONELAN JOUTSEN&rdquo;), LEGEND FROM THE FINNISH FOLK EPIC &ldquo;KALEVALA&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Here is no swan, singing before death, a fable that suggested to
Villiers de l&rsquo;Isle-Adam one of his cruelest tales, and served Anna
Pavlowa for an entrancing, memorable dance-pantomime to Saint-Sa&euml;ns&rsquo;
familiar music. This is the swan that glides and sings on the
river of black water around Tuonela, the Kingdom of Death.
Sibelius, to whom the Finnish epic <i>Kalevala</i> furnished subjects for
several of his earlier compositions, by economic means, by an unerring
choice of his instruments, portrays the scene and gives the
song&mdash;after the hearer is acquainted with the explanatory note in
the score. Suppose that the hearer had no knowledge of the legend,
had never read of Lemminkainen&rsquo;s adventures; how, to win the
maid Pohjola, he set out to accomplish certain tasks, among them
to shoot a swan on this River of Death. How would the hearer
then be impressed? Surely he would be moved by the strangeness
of the music, by the mysterious first measures, by the unearthly
melancholy of the song, by the quiet intensity of it all. He would
find in the music a tragic mood, simply but unmistakably expressed.
To us this legend of Sibelius, for itself, is commanding
music.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>The Swan of Tuonela</i> is the third section of a symphonic poem
<i>Lemminkainen</i>, in four parts, Op. 22, 1. &ldquo;Lemminkainen and the
Maidens&rdquo;; 2. &ldquo;His Sojourn in Tuonela&rdquo;; 3. &ldquo;The Swan of Tuonela&rdquo;;
4. &ldquo;Lemminkainen Homefaring.&rdquo; These pieces are drawn from the
Finnish epic <i>Kalevala</i>. A note on the score of <i>The Swan of Tuonela</i>
runs thus: &ldquo;Tuonela, the Kingdom of Death, the Hades of Finnish
mythology, is surrounded by a broad river of black water and rapid
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
current, in which the Swan of Tuonela glides in majestic fashion and
sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lemminkainen is one of the four principal heroes of the <i>Kalevala</i>.
Mr. W. F. Kirby, in his translation of the epic, describes him as a
&ldquo;jovial, reckless personage, always getting into serious scrapes, from
which he escapes either by his own skill in magic or by his mother&rsquo;s.
His love for his mother is the redeeming feature in his character.
One of his names is Kaukomieli, and he is, in part, the original of
Longfellow&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pau-Puk-Keewis.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the thirteenth and fourteenth Runos, it is told how Lemminkainen
asks the old woman of Pohja for her daughter Pohjola. She
demands that he should first accomplish certain tasks: to capture on
snowshoes the elk of Hiisi; to bridle fire-breathing steeds. Succeeding
in these adventures, he is asked to shoot a swan on the river of
Tuonela.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>I will only give my daughter,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Give the youthful bride you seek for,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>If the river swan you shoot me,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Shoot the great bird on the river;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>There on Tuoni&rsquo;s murky river,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>In the sacred river&rsquo;s whirlpool,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Only at a single trial,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Using but a single arrow.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Lemminkainen came to the river. A cowherd, M&auml;rk&auml;hattu, old and
sightless, who had long waited for him, slew him there by sending a
serpent &ldquo;like a reed from out the billows&rdquo; through the hero&rsquo;s heart,
and cast the body into the stream. Lemminkainen floated on to
Tuonela&rsquo;s dread dwelling. The son of Tuoni cut the body into pieces.
The hero&rsquo;s mother, learning of his fate, raked the water under the
cataract till she found all the fragments. She joined them together
and restored her son to life by charms and magic salves, so that he
could return home with her.</p>
<p>The piece is written in A minor, <i>andante molto sostenuto</i> 9-4 time.
Mrs. Rosa Newmarch (<i>Jean Sibelius</i>) says of it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majestic but intensely sad, swan-like melody is heard as a
solo for <i>cor-anglais</i>, accompanied at first by muted strings and the soft
roll of drums. Now and then this melody is answered by a phrase
given to first violoncello or viola, which might be interpreted as the
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
farewell sigh of some soul passing to Tuonela. For many bars the
brass is silent, until suddenly the first horn (muted) echoes a few
notes of the swan melody with the most poignant effect. Gradually
the music works up to a great climax, indicated <i>con gran suono</i>, followed
by a treble <i>pianissimo</i>, the strings playing with the back of the
bow. To this accompaniment, which suggests the faint flapping of
pinions, the swan&rsquo;s final phrases are sung. The strings return to the
natural bowing and the work ends in one of the characteristic, sighing
phrases for violoncello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second theme is given out by the strings to a slow but rhythmed
accompaniment of wood-wind, brass, and drums.</p>
<p>The score calls for oboe, English horn (solo), bass clarinet, two
bassoons, four horns, three trombones, kettledrums, bass drum, harp,
and the usual strings.</p>

<h2 id="c137"><span class="h2line1">RICHARD</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRAUSS</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Munich, June 11, 1864)</p>
<h2 id="c138"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;DON JUAN,&rdquo; TONE POEM (AFTER NICOLAUS LENAU), OP. 20</span></h2>
<p>Some of Strauss&rsquo;s wild-eyed worshipers, not content with the
quotations that serve as mottoes, have invented ingenious analyses
in which we are told the precise meaning of each theme in <i>Don
Juan</i>, and how this section represents his passion for a widow and
that for a maiden. But did not Strauss himself say that the theme
which represents, according to an analyst, Don Juan rushing off to
new triumphs was intended as his drunken entrance into a ballroom?
And is it not possible that when Strauss wrote down this
theme he attached no specific and minute significance to it? No,
there is no need of the showman with blackboard and rod while
this music is playing. &ldquo;Don Juan&mdash;after Lenau&rsquo;s poem&rdquo; is enough;
and merely <i>Don Juan</i> might serve.</p>
<p>A daring, brilliant composition: one that paints the hero as
might a master&rsquo;s brush on canvas. How expressive the themes!
How daring the treatment of them! What fascinating, irresistible
insolence, glowing passion, and then the taste of Dead Sea fruit!</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Don Juan</i>, composed at Munich 1887-88, is known as the first of
Strauss&rsquo;s symphonic or tone poems, but <i>Macbeth</i>, Op. 23, was composed
at Munich, 1886-87 (revised in 1890 at Weimar), and published
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
later (1891). <i>Don Juan</i> was published in 1890. The first performance
of <i>Don Juan</i> was at the second subscription concert of the Grand
Ducal Court Orchestra of Weimar in the fall of 1889.</p>
<p>The work is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three
trumpets, three trombones, tuba, kettledrums, triangle, cymbals,
glockenspiel, harp, strings. The score is dedicated &ldquo;To my dear friend,
Ludwig Thuille,&rdquo; a composer and teacher, born at Bozen in 1861, who
was a fellow student at Munich. Thuille died in 1907.</p>
<p class="tb">Strauss&rsquo;s hero is Lenau&rsquo;s, in search of the ideal woman. Not finding
one reaching his standard, disgusted with life, he practically commits
suicide by dropping his sword when fighting a duel with a man whose
father he had killed. Before this Don Juan dies, he provides in his will
for the women he had seduced and forsaken.</p>
<p>Lenau wrote his poem in 1844. It is said that his third revision was
made in August and September of that year at Vienna and Stuttgart.
After September he wrote no more, for he went mad, and he was mad
until he died in 1850. The poem, &ldquo;Eitel nichts,&rdquo; dedicated in the
asylum at Winnenthal, was intended originally for <i>Don Juan</i>. <i>Don Juan</i>
is of a somewhat fragmentary nature. The quotations made by Strauss
paint well the hero&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>L. A. Frankl, a biographer of the morbid poet, says that Lenau once
spoke as follows concerning his purpose in this dramatic poem:
&ldquo;Goethe&rsquo;s great poem has not hurt me in the matter of <i>Faust</i> and
Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; will here do me no harm. Each poet, as every
human being, is an individual ego. My Don Juan is no hot-blooded
man eternally pursuing woman. It is the longing in him to find a
woman who is to him incarnate womanhood, and to enjoy in the one,
all the women on earth, whom he cannot as individuals possess. Because
he does not find her, although he reels from one to another, at
last Disgust seizes hold of him, and this Disgust is the Devil that
fetches him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said that the &ldquo;emotional phases of the story&rdquo; appealed to
Strauss:</p>
<p>1. The fiery ardor with which Don Juan pursues his ideal;</p>
<p>2. The charm of woman; and</p>
<p>3. The selfish idealist&rsquo;s disappointment and partial atonement by
death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>There are two ways of considering this tone poem: to say that it
is a fantasia, free in form and development&mdash;the quotations from the
poem are enough to show the mood and the purposes of the composer;
or to discuss the character of Lenau&rsquo;s hero, and then follow
foreign commentators who give significance to every melodic phrase
and find deep, esoteric meaning in every modulation. No doubt
Strauss himself would be content with the verses of Lenau and his own
music, for he is a man not without humor, and on more than one occasion
has slyly smiled at his prying or pontifical interpreters.</p>
<p>Strauss has particularized his hero among the many that bear the
name of Don Juan, from the old drama of Gabriel Tellez, the cloistered
monk who wrote, under the name of &ldquo;Tirso de Molina,&rdquo; <i>El Burlador
de Sevilla y el Convidado de Piedra</i> (first printed in 1634). Strauss&rsquo;s
hero is specifically the Don Juan of Lenau, not the rakehelly hero of
legend and so many plays, who at the last is undone by the Statue invited
by Juan to supper.</p>
<h2 id="c139"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;TOD UND VERKL&Auml;RUNG&rdquo; (DEATH AND TRANSFIGURATION) TONE POEM, OP. 24</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Death and Transfiguration&rdquo; is now more old-fashioned than
the G minor symphony of Mozart. The anguish of the dying man,
who does not make the graceful and gracious apology of Charles II
on his deathbed, no longer moves us. His recollections seem sentimental
and vapid, while the trombone passages once considered
as terrific, awe-inspiring, are not so significant as the single horn of
Charon in Gluck&rsquo;s <i>Alceste</i>. <i>Don Juan</i>, on the other hand, holds its
own by its defiant spirit, expressing the arrogance of the Don on
his triumphant way&mdash;by its dramatic translation into music of the
words put by Lenau into his mouth:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Exhausted is the fuel;</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>And on the hearth, the cold is fiercely cruel.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The superb horn phrase should have accompanied the entrance
of Lovelace into the ballroom, one of the most powerful scenes in
Richardson&rsquo;s long-winded romance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This tone poem was composed at Munich in 1888-89.</p>
<p>Hans von B&uuml;low wrote to his wife from Weimar, November 13,
1889: &ldquo;Strauss is enormously beloved here. His <i>Don Juan</i> evening
before last had a wholly unheard-of success. Yesterday morning
Spitzweg and I were at his house to hear his new symphonic poem
<i>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</i>&mdash;which has again inspired me with great confidence
in his development. It is a very important work in spite of
sundry poor passages, and it is also refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first performance was from manuscript, under the direction of
the composer, at the fifth concert of the 27th Musicians&rsquo; Convention
of the Allgemeine Deutscher Musikverein in the City Theater of
Eisenach, June 21, 1890.</p>
<p>The poem is dedicated to Friedrich R&ouml;sch, and is scored for three
flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two
bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones,
tuba, a set of three kettledrums, two harps, gong, and strings.</p>
<p>On the flyleaf of the score is a poem in German.</p>
<p>The following literal translation is by William Foster Apthorp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the necessitous little room, dimly lighted by only a candle end,
lies the sick man on his bed. But just now he has wrestled despairingly
with Death. Now he has sunk exhausted into sleep, and one hears
only the soft ticking of the clock on the wall in the room, whose awful
silence gives a foreboding of the nearness of death. Over the sick
man&rsquo;s pale features plays a sad smile. Dreams he, on the boundary of
life, of the golden time of childhood?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But death does not long grant sleep and dreams to his victim.
Cruelly he shakes him awake, and the fight begins afresh. Will to live
and power of Death! What frightful wrestling! Neither bears off the
victory, and all is silent once more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunk back tired of battle, sleepless, as in fever-frenzy the sick man
now sees his life pass before his inner eye, trait by trait and scene by
scene. First the morning red of childhood, shining bright in pure
innocence! Then the youth&rsquo;s saucier play&mdash;exerting and trying his
strength&mdash;till he ripens to the man&rsquo;s fight, and now burns with hot
lust after the higher prizes of life. The one high purpose that has led
him through life was to shape all he saw transfigured into a still more
transfigured form. Cold and sneering, the world sets barrier upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_312">312</span>
barrier in the way of his achievement. If he thinks himself near his
goal, a &lsquo;Halt!&rsquo; thunders in his ear. &lsquo;Make the barrier thy stirrup! Ever
higher and onward go!&rsquo; And so he pushes forward, so he climbs,
desists not from his sacred purpose. What he has ever sought with his
heart&rsquo;s deepest yearning, he still seeks in his death sweat. Seeks&mdash;alas!
and finds it never. Whether he comprehends it more clearly or it
grows upon him gradually, he can yet never exhaust it, cannot complete
it in his spirit. Then clangs the last stroke of Death&rsquo;s iron
hammer, breaks the earthly body in twain, covers the eye with the
night of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But from the heavenly spaces sounds mightily to greet him what
he yearningly sought for here: deliverance from the world, transfiguration
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The poem by Ritter is, after all, the most satisfactory explanation of
the music to those that seek eagerly a clew and are not content with
the title. The analysts have been busy with this tone poem as well as
the others of Strauss. Wilhelm Mauke wrote a pamphlet of twenty
pages with twenty-one musical illustrations, and made a delicate distinction
between &ldquo;Fever&rdquo; theme No. 1 and &ldquo;Fever&rdquo; theme No. 2.
Reimann and Brandes have been more moderate. <i>Death and Transfiguration</i>
may be divided into sections, closely joined, and for each
one a portion of the poem may serve as a motto.</p>
<p>I. <i>Largo</i>, C minor, D flat major, 4-4. The chief &ldquo;Death&rdquo; motive is
a syncopated figure, <i>pianissimo</i>, given to the second violins and violas.
A sad smile steals over the sick man&rsquo;s face (wood-wind accompanied
by horns and harps), and he thinks of his youth (a simple melody, the
childhood motive, announced by the oboe). These three motives
establish the mood of the introduction.</p>
<p>II. <i>Allegro molto agitato</i>, C minor. Death attacks the sick man.
There are harsh double blows in quick succession. What Mauke characterizes
as the &ldquo;Fever&rdquo; motive begins in the basses, and wildly dissonant
chords shriek at the end of the climbing motive. There is a
mighty <i>crescendo</i>, the chief &ldquo;Death&rdquo; motive is heard, the struggle
begins (full orchestra, <i>fortississimo</i>). There is a second chromatic and
feverish motive, which appears first in sixteenths, which is bound to a
contrasting and ascending theme that recalls the motive of the struggle.
This second feverish theme goes canonically through the instrument
groups. The sick man sinks exhausted (<i>ritenuto</i>). Trombones, violoncellos,
<span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
and violas intone even now the beginning of the &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo;
theme, just as Death is about to triumph. &ldquo;And again all is
still!&rdquo; The mysterious &ldquo;Death&rdquo; motive knocks.</p>
<p>III. And now the dying man dreams dreams and sees visions (<i>meno
mosso, ma sempre alla breve</i>). The &ldquo;Childhood&rdquo; motive returns
(G major) in freer form. There is again the joy of youth (oboes, harp,
and, bound to this motive of &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; that made him smile before the
struggle, the motive now played by solo viola). The fight of manhood
with the world&rsquo;s prizes is waged again (B major, full orchestra,
<i>fortissimo</i>), waged fiercely. &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; thunders in his ears, and trombones
and kettledrums sound the dread and strangely rhythmed motive of
&ldquo;Death&rdquo; (drums beaten with wooden drumsticks). There is contrapuntal
elaboration of the &ldquo;Life Struggle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Childhood&rdquo; motives.
The &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; motive is heard in broader form. The chief
&ldquo;Death&rdquo; motive and the feverish attack are again dominating features.
Storm and fury of orchestra. There is a wild series of ascending fifths.
Tam-tam and harp knell the soul&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>IV. The &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; theme is heard from the horns; strings
repeat the &ldquo;Childhood&rdquo; motive. A <i>crescendo</i> leads to the full development
of the &ldquo;Transfiguration&rdquo; theme (<i>moderato</i>, C major), &ldquo;World
deliverance, world transfiguration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scoring is as follows: three flutes, two oboes, English horn, two
clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four horns, three
trumpets, three trombones and bass tuba, kettledrums, tam-tam, two
harps, and strings.</p>
<h2 id="c140"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;TILL EULENSPIEGEL&rsquo;S MERRY PRANKS, AFTER THE OLD-FASHIONED ROGUISH MANNER&mdash;IN RONDO FORM,&rdquo; OP. 28</span></h2>
<p><i>Till Eulenspiegel</i> disputes with <i>Don Juan</i> the first position among
the symphonic poems of Strauss. The opening of <i>Thus Spake
Zarathustra</i> is colossal in its elemental grandeur; the death music
in <i>Don Quixote</i> is incomparably beautiful; there are a few pages in
<i>A Hero&rsquo;s Life</i> that remind one of Beethoven at his best; the love
music in the <i>Domestic symphony</i> is memorable; but <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i>
and <i>Don Juan</i> are continuously impressive, each in its way,
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
and are free from the suspicion of effects made for the sake of
effect, designed deliberately to make the bourgeois stare.</p>
<p class="tb">The story is medieval and Rabelaisian, and the music is quite as
broad as the tale. Clear motives typify Till, who can be traced from
beginning to end. He &ldquo;bobs up&rdquo; (no other term can describe it)
through every kind of repression and persecution; he is saucy and
insouciant; he is comically repentant when at the last he is hanged,
and his last faint squeak is very mock-pathetic.</p>
<p>This hanging is a deviant from the old story in which Till evades
his doom and cheats the executioner. For some time the reviewers
were in doubt as to whether Strauss had given warrant for the
execution&mdash;which shows the weak point of &ldquo;programme music,&rdquo;
for no one ought to have had any doubts upon the subject after
hearing the change of style from glibness to utter dejection at the
end.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s lustige Streiche, nach alter Schelmenweise&mdash;in
Rondoform, f&uuml;r grosses Orchester gesetzt, von Richard Strauss</i>, was
produced at a G&uuml;rznich concert at Cologne, November 5, 1895. It was
composed in 1894-95 at Munich, and the score was completed there,
May 6, 1895. The score and parts were published in September, 1895.</p>
<p>There has been dispute concerning the proper translation of the
phrase, <i>nach alter Schelmenweise</i>, in the title. Some, and Apthorp was
one of them, translate it &ldquo;after an old rogue&rsquo;s tune.&rdquo; Others will not
have this at all, and prefer &ldquo;after the old&mdash;or old-fashioned&mdash;roguish
manner,&rdquo; or, as Krehbiel suggested, &ldquo;in the style of old-time waggery,&rdquo;
and this view is in all probability the sounder. It is hard to twist
<i>Schelmenweise</i> into &ldquo;rogue&rsquo;s tune.&rdquo; <i>Schelmenst&uuml;ck</i>, for instance, is &ldquo;a
knavish trick,&rdquo; a &ldquo;piece of roguery.&rdquo; As Krehbiel well said: &ldquo;The reference
[<i>Schelmenweise</i>] goes, not to the thematic form of the phrase,
but to its structure. This is indicated, not only by the grammatical form
of the phrase but also by the parenthetical explanation: &lsquo;<i>in Rondoform</i>.&rsquo;
What connection exists between roguishness, or waggishness, and the
rondo form it might be difficult to explain. The roguish wag in this
case is Richard Strauss himself, who, besides putting the puzzle into
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
his title, refused to provide the composition with even the smallest
explanatory note which might have given a clue to its contents.&rdquo; It
seems to us that the puzzle in the title is largely imaginary. There is
no need of attributing any intimate connection between &ldquo;roguish
manner&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>rondo</i> form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Till (or Tyll) Eulenspiegel is the hero of an old <i>Volksbuch</i> of the
fifteenth century attributed to Dr. Thomas Murner (1475-1530). Till is
supposed to be a wandering mechanic of Brunswick, who plays all
sorts of tricks, practical jokes&mdash;some of them exceedingly coarse&mdash;on
everybody, and he always comes out ahead. In the book, Till (or Till
Owlglass, as he is known in the English translation) goes to the
gallows, but he escapes through an exercise of his ready wit and dies
peacefully in bed, playing a sad joke on his heirs, and refusing to lie
still and snug in his grave. Strauss kills him on the scaffold. The German
name is said to find its derivation in an old proverb: &ldquo;Man sees
his own faults as little as a monkey or an owl recognizes his ugliness
in looking into a mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dr. Franz W&uuml;llner, who conducted the first performance at
Cologne, asked the composer for an explanatory programme of the
&ldquo;poetical intent&rdquo; of the piece, Strauss replied: &ldquo;It is impossible for me
to furnish a programme to <i>Eulenspiegel</i>; were I to put into words the
thoughts which its several incidents suggest to me, they would seldom
suffice, and might give rise to offense. Let me leave it, therefore, to
my hearers to crack the hard nut which the Rogue has prepared for
them. By way of helping them to a better understanding, it seems
sufficient to point out the two &lsquo;Eulenspiegel&rsquo; motives, which, in the
most manifold disguises, moods, and situations, pervade the whole up
to the catastrophe, when, after he has been condemned to death, Till is
strung up to the gibbet. For the rest, let them guess at the musical joke
which a Rogue has offered them.&rdquo; Strauss indicated in notation three
motives&mdash;the opening theme of the introduction, the horn theme that
follows almost immediately, and the descending interval expressive of
condemnation and the scaffold.</p>
<p>The rondo, dedicated to Dr. Arthur Seidl, is scored for piccolo, three
flutes, three oboes, English horn, small clarinet in E flat, two clarinets,
bass clarinet, three bassoons, double bassoon, four horns (with the
addition of four horns <i>ad lib.</i>), three trumpets (with three additional
trumpets <i>ad lib.</i>), three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, snare drum,
bass drum, cymbals, triangle, a watchman&rsquo;s rattle, strings.</p>

<h2 id="c141"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA,&rdquo; TONE POEM (FREELY AFTER FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE), OP. 30</span></h2>
<p>Strauss&rsquo;s huge &ldquo;machine&rdquo; has aged. The opening measures are
still stupendous. The &ldquo;Grave Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Night Song&rdquo; are not
without compelling beauty, but on the whole, Nietzschian philosophy
and music do not dwell together in harmony. Dismiss the
thought of Nietzsche; consider the music as absolute music, and
there is much that is boresome and inherently cheap, if not vulgar,
in spite, or by reason of the bombast and pretentiousness.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The full title of this composition is <i>Also sprach Zarathustra, Tondichtung</i>
(<i>frei nach Friedrich Nietzsche</i>) <i>f&uuml;r grosses Orchester</i>. Composition
was begun at Munich, February 4, 1896, and completed there
August 24, 1896. The first performance was at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
November 27 of the same year. The composer conducted, and also at
Cologne, December 1.</p>
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche conceived the plan to his <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra:
A Book for All and None</i>, in August, 1881, as he was walking through
the woods near the Silvaplana Lake in the Engadine and saw a huge
tower-like crag. He completed the first part in February, 1883, at
Rapallo, near Genoa; he wrote the second part in Sils Maria in June
and July, the third part in the following winter at Nice, and the fourth
part, not then intended to be the last, but to serve as an interlude,
from November, 1884, till February, 1885, at Mentone. Nietzsche never
published this fourth part; it was printed for private circulation and
not publicly issued till after he became insane. The whole of
<i>Zarathustra</i> was published in 1892.</p>
<p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Zarathustra is by no means the historical or legendary
Zoroaster, mage, leader, warrior, king. The Zarathustra of Nietzsche is
Nietzsche himself, with his views on life and death. Strauss&rsquo;s opera
<i>Guntram</i> (1894) showed the composer&rsquo;s interest in the book. Before
the tone poem was performed, this programme was published: &ldquo;First
movement: Sunrise, Man feels the power of God. <i>Andante religioso.</i>
But man still longs. He plunges into passion (second movement) and
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
finds no peace. He turns towards science, and tries in vain to solve
life&rsquo;s problem in a fugue (third movement). Then agreeable dance
tunes sound and he becomes an individual, and his soul soars upward
while the world sinks far beneath him.&rdquo; But Strauss gave this explanation
to Otto Florsheim: &ldquo;I did not intend to write philosophical
music or to portray in music Nietzsche&rsquo;s great work. I meant to convey
by means of music an idea of the development of the human race from
its origin, through the various phases of its development, religious and
scientific, up to Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea of the Superman. The whole symphonic
poem is intended as my homage to Nietzsche&rsquo;s genius, which
found its greatest exemplification in his book, <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> is scored for piccolo, three flutes (one interchangeable
with a second piccolo), three oboes, English horn, two
clarinets in B flat, clarinet in E flat, bass clarinet, three bassoons, double
bassoon, six horns, four trumpets, three trombones, two bass tubas,
kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, glockenspiel, a low bell in
E, two harps, organ, sixteen second violins, twelve violas, twelve
violoncellos, eight double basses.</p>
<p>On a flyleaf of a score is printed the following excerpts from
Nietzsche&rsquo;s book, the first section of &ldquo;Zarathustra&rsquo;s Introductory
Speech&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having attained the age of thirty, Zarathustra left his home and
the lake of his home and went into the mountains. There he rejoiced
in his spirit and his loneliness, and for ten years did not grow weary
of it. But at last his heart turned&mdash;one morning he got up with the
dawn, stepped into the presence of the Sun and thus spake unto him:
&lsquo;Thou great star! What would be thy happiness, were it not for those
on whom thou shinest? For ten years thou hast come up here to my
cave. Thou wouldst have got sick of thy light and thy journey but for
me, mine eagle and my serpent. But we waited for thee every morning
and receiving from thee thine abundance, blessed thee for it. Lo! I am
weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath collected too much honey;
I need hands reaching out for it. I would fain grant and distribute
until the wise among men could once more enjoy their folly, and the
poor once more their riches. For that end I must descend to the depth;
as thou dost at even, when sinking behind the sea, thou givest light to
the lower regions, thou resplendent star! I must, like thee, go down, as
men say&mdash;men to whom I would descend. Then bless me, thou impassive
eye, that canst look without envy even upon overmuch happiness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
Bless the cup which is about to overflow, so that the water
golden-flowing out of it may carry everywhere the reflection of thy
rapture. Lo! this cup is about to empty itself again, and Zarathustra
will once more become a man.&rsquo;&mdash;Thus Zarathustra&rsquo;s going down
began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This prefatory note in Strauss&rsquo;s tone poem is not a &ldquo;programme&rdquo; of
the composition itself. It is merely an introduction. The sub-captions of
the composer in the score indicate that the music after the short
musical introduction begins where the quotation ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scene of <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i>,&rdquo; says Dr. Tille, &ldquo;is laid, as it
were, outside of time and space, and certainly outside of countries and
nations, outside of this age, and outside of the main condition of all
that lives&mdash;the struggle for existence.... There appear cities and
mobs, kings and scholars, poets and cripples, but outside of their realm
there is a province which is Zarathustra&rsquo;s own, where he lives in his
cave amid the rocks, and whence he thrice goes to men to teach them
his wisdom. This Nowhere and Nowhen, over which Nietzsche&rsquo;s
imagination is supreme, is a province of boundless individualism, in
which a man of mark has free play, unfettered by the tastes and
inclinations of the multitude.... <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> is a kind of
summary of the intellectual life of the nineteenth century, and it is
on this fact that its principal significance rests. It unites in itself a
number of mental movements which, in literature as well as in various
sciences, have made themselves felt separately during the last hundred
years, without going far beyond them. By bringing them into contact,
although not always into uncontradictory relation, Nietzsche transfers
them from mere existence in philosophy, or scientific literature in
general, into the sphere or the creed of <i>Weltanschauung</i> of the educated
classes, and thus his book becomes capable of influencing the
views and strivings of a whole age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zarathustra teaches men the deification of Life. He offers not joy of
life, for to him there is no such thing, but fullness of life, in the joy
of the senses, &ldquo;in the triumphant exuberance of vitality, in the pure,
lofty naturalness of the antique, in short, in the fusion of God, world,
and ego.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">There is a simple but impressive introduction, in which there is a
solemn trumpet motive, which leads to a great climax for full orchestra
and organ on the chord of C major. There is this heading, &ldquo;Von den
<span class="pb" id="Page_319">319</span>
Hinterweltlern&rdquo; (Of the Dwellers in the Rear World). These are they
who sought the solution in religion. Zarathustra too had once dwelt
in this rear world. (Horns intone a solemn Gregorian <i>Credo</i>.)</p>
<p>The next heading is &ldquo;Von der grossen Sehnsucht&rdquo; (Of the Great
Yearning). This stands over an ascending passage in B minor in
violoncellos and bassoons, answered by wood-wind instruments in
chromatic thirds.</p>
<p>The next section begins with a pathetic <i>cantilena</i> in C minor (second
violins, oboes, horn), and the heading is: &ldquo;Von den Freuden und
Leidenschaften&rdquo; (Of Joys and Passions).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grablied&rdquo; (Grave Song). The oboe has a tender <i>cantilena</i> over the
Yearning motive in violoncellos and bassoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Von der Wissenschaft&rdquo; (Of Science). The fugued passage begins
with violoncellos and double basses (divided). The subject of this
<i>fugato</i> contains all the diatonic and chromatic degrees of the scale, and
the real responses to this subject come in successively a fifth higher.</p>
<p>Much farther on a passage in the strings, beginning in the violoncellos
and violas, arises from B minor. &ldquo;Der Genesende&rdquo; (The Convalescent).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tanzlied.&rdquo; The dance song begins with laughter in the wood-wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nachtlied&rdquo; (Night Song).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nachtwanderlied&rdquo; (The Song of the Night Wanderer, though
Nietzsche in later editions changed the title to &ldquo;The Drunken Song&rdquo;).
The song comes after a <i>fortissimo</i> stroke of the bell, and the bell,
sounding twelve times, dies away softly.</p>
<p>The mystical conclusion has excited much discussion. The ending is
in two keys&mdash;in B major in the high wood-wind and violins, in
C major in the basses, <i>pizzicato</i>. &ldquo;The theme of the Ideal sways aloft
in the higher regions in B major; the trombones insist on the unresolved
chord of C, E, F sharp; and in the double basses is repeated
C, G, C, the World Riddle.&rdquo; This riddle is unsolved by Nietzsche, by
Strauss, and even by Strauss&rsquo;s commentators.</p>

<h2 id="c142"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;DON QUIXOTE,&rdquo; FANTASTIC VARIATIONS ON A THEME OF KNIGHTLY CHARACTER, OP. 35<br />INTRODUCTION, THEME WITH VARIATIONS, AND FINALE</span></h2>
<p>Don Quixote, a virtuoso tone poem, shows Strauss at his best
and at his worst. Composers have laid violent hands on the world-famous
novel of Cervantes. The Knight has figured in both serious
and comic operas. It occurred to Strauss that Don Quixote might
be portrayed by one instrument, Sancho Panza by another. Strauss
undoubtedly rubbed his hands with glee at the thought of the musical
representation of ba-a-a-ing sheep and the opportunity of introducing
a wind machine with a man turning a crank for the
variation, &ldquo;The Ride through the Air.&rdquo; But there are fine passages
in the work. When Don Quixote speaks nobly of the ideal, Strauss
gives him noble music, and Strauss has seldom written more charming
music than for the last speech of Sancho Panza. One might
ask, however, if this music is in Sancho Panza&rsquo;s character as Cervantes
describes it. And in the final music&mdash;the disillusionment of
Don Quixote and his death&mdash;Strauss attains, without straining and
exaggeration, an emotional height that is seldom found in his instrumental
compositions that follow. Hearing these emotional sections
one almost forgets the imitative and pictorial passages of the
work, which seem too long, with much music that is of little worth
and interest.</p>

<p><i>Don Quixote</i> (<i>Introduzione, Tema con Variazioni, e Finale</i>): <i>Fantastische

his composition on March 18, 1898, at a concert of the Frankfort
Museumgesellschaft, when Hugo Becker was the violoncellist. It is
said that Becker composed an exceedingly piquant <i>cadenza</i> for violoncello
on the &ldquo;Quixote&rdquo; motive for his own enjoyment at home.</p>
<p>The work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn,
two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, double bassoon, six horns,
three trumpets, three trombones, tenor tuba, bass tuba, kettledrums,
snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, wind machine,
harp, sixteen first violins, sixteen second violins, twelve violas, ten
violoncellos, eight double basses. It is dedicated to Joseph Dupont.</p>
<p>Much has been written in explanation of this work, which followed
<i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i>, Op. 30 (1896), and preceded <i>Ein Heldenleben</i>,
Op. 40 (1898). As the story goes, at a music festival in D&uuml;sseldorf in
1899 an acquaintance of Strauss complained bitterly before the rehearsal
that he had no printed &ldquo;guide&rdquo; to <i>Don Quixote</i>, with which he
was unfamiliar. Strauss laughed, and said for his consolation, &ldquo;Get out!
you do not need any.&rdquo; Arthur Hahn wrote a pamphlet of twenty-seven
pages in elucidation. In this pamphlet are many wondrous things. We
are told that certain queer harmonies introduced in an otherwise simple
passage of the introduction &ldquo;characterize admirably the well-known
tendency of Don Quixote toward false conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no programme attached to the score of this work. The
arrangement for pianoforte gives certain information concerning the
composer&rsquo;s purposes.</p>
<p>Max Steinitzer declares in his <i>Richard Strauss</i> (Berlin and Leipsic,
1911) that with the exception of some details, as the &ldquo;Windmill&rdquo;
episode, the music is intelligible and effective as absolute music; that
the title is sufficiently explanatory. &ldquo;The introduction begins immediately
with the hero&rsquo;s motive and pictures with constantly increasing
liveliness by other themes of knightly and gallant character
life as it is mirrored in writings from the beginning of the seventeenth
century. &lsquo;Don Quixote, busied in reading romances of chivalry, loses
his reason&mdash;and determines to go through the world as a wandering
knight.&rsquo;&rdquo; It is easy to recognize the hero&rsquo;s theme in its variations,
because the knight is always represented by the solo violoncello. The
character of Sancho Panza is expressed by a theme first given to bass
clarinet and tenor tuba; but afterward and to the end by a solo viola.
<i>Don Quixote</i> is divided into an introduction, a theme with variations,
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
and a <i>finale</i>. The sections are connected without a break. Each variation
portrays an incident in the novel.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Introduction</span></h3>
<p><i>M&auml;ssiges Zeitmass</i> (<i>moderato</i>), D major, 4-4. Don Quixote plunged
himself deeply in his reading of books of knighthood, &ldquo;and in the end,
through his little sleep and much reading, he dried up his brains in
such sort, as he lost wholly his judgment. His fantasy was filled with
those things that he read, of enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges,
wounds, wooings, loves, tempests, and other impossible follies.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> The
first theme (wind instruments) foreshadows the typical Don Quixote
motive, and is here typical of knight-errantry in general. The next
section (strings) represents the idea of knightly gallantry, and the
whole theme ends with the passages that include the strange harmonies
and portray his madness. These strange progressions recur frequently
throughout the work. &ldquo;He does not dream,&rdquo; says Mr. H. W. Harris,
&ldquo;that his reasoning is at fault or that he is the victim of self-delusion;
on the contrary, he ascribes all such discrepancies to magic, by which he
believes himself to be persecuted, which is clearly being employed to
make things appear otherwise than his judgment assures him they
really should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first section of the first theme is ornamented (violas). Don
Quixote grows more and more romantic and chivalric. He sees the
Ideal Woman, his lady-love (oboe). The trumpets tell of a giant
attacking her and her rescue by a knight. &ldquo;In this part of the Introduction,
the use of mutes on all the instruments&mdash;including the tuba, here
so treated for the first time&mdash;creates an indescribable effect of vagueness
and confusion, indicating that they are mere phantasms with
which the Knight is concerned, which cloud his brain.&rdquo; A Penitent
enters (muted violas <i>fortissimo</i>). Don Quixote&rsquo;s brain grows more and
more confused. The orchestral themes grow wilder. An augmented
version of the first section of the theme (brass), followed by a harp
<i>glissando</i>, leads to shrill discord&mdash;the Knight is mad. &ldquo;The repeated use
of the various sections of the first theme shows that his madness has
something to do with chivalry.&rdquo; Don Quixote has decided to be a
knight-errant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Theme</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Don Quixote, the knight of the sorrowful countenance; Sancho
Panza.&rdquo; <i>Moderato</i>, D minor, 4-4. The Don Quixote theme is announced
by solo violoncello. It is of close kin to the theme of the
introduction. Sancho Panza is typified by a theme given first to bass
clarinet and tenor tuba; but afterward the solo viola is the characteristic
instrument of Sancho.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation I</span></h3>
<p>The Knight and the Squire set out on their journey. &ldquo;In a leisurely
manner,&rdquo; D minor, 12-8. The beautiful Dulcinea of Toboso inspires
the Knight (a version of the &ldquo;Ideal Woman&rdquo; theme), who soon sees
some windmills (brass) and prepares to attack. A breeze arises (wood-wind
and strings), and the Knight, angry at the challenge, attacks,
and is knocked down by the sails (run in wood-wind, harp <i>glissando</i>,
heavy drum-beats).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation II</span></h3>
<p>The Victorious Battle against the Host of the Great Emperor
Alifanfaron. &ldquo;Warlike,&rdquo; D major, 4-4. There is a cloud of dust; surely
a great army approaches; the Knight rushes to fight, in spite of the
warnings of Sancho, who sees the sheep. There is a pastoral figure
(wood-wind), and out of the dust cloud (strings) comes a chorus of
&ldquo;Ba-a-a-a&rdquo; (muted brass). Don Quixote charges and puts the foes to
confusion.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation III</span></h3>
<p>The Dialogues of the Knight and the Squire. <i>Moderato</i>, 4-4. Sancho
questions the worth of such a life. Don Quixote speaks of honor and
glory (first theme), but Sancho sees nothing in them. The dispute
waxes hot. Don Quixote speaks nobly of the ideal. Sancho prefers the
easy, comfortable realities of life. At last his master is angry and bids
him hold his tongue.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation IV</span></h3>
<p>The Adventure with the Penitents. &ldquo;Somewhat broader,&rdquo; D minor,
4-4. A church theme (wind instruments) announces the approach of
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
a band of pilgrims. Don Quixote sees in them shameless robbers, desperate
villains. He attacks them. They knock him senseless and go
on their prayerful way. Sancho, sorely disturbed, rejoices when his
master shows signs of life, and after he has helped him, lies down by
his side and goes to sleep (bass tuba, double bassoon).</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation V</span></h3>
<p>The Knight&rsquo;s Vigil. &ldquo;Very slow,&rdquo; 4-4. Don Quixote, ashamed to
sleep, holds watch by his armor. Dulcinea, answering his prayers,
appears in a vision (the &ldquo;Ideal Woman&rdquo; theme, horn). A <i>cadenza</i> for
harp and violins leads to a passage portraying his rapture.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation VI</span></h3>
<p>The Meeting with Dulcinea. G major, 2-4, 3-4. A common country
wench comes along (wood-wind, tambourine), and Sancho by way of
jest points her out to his master as Dulcinea. The Knight cannot believe
it. Sancho swears it is so. The Knight suddenly knows that some magic
has worked this transformation, and he vows vengeance.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation VII</span></h3>
<p>The Ride through the Air. D minor, 8-4. Knight and Squire sit,
blindfolded, on a wooden horse, which, they have been made to
believe, will bear them through the air. Their respective themes soar
skyward. The wind whistles about them (chromatic flute passages, harp,
drum roll, wind machine). They stop suddenly (long-held bassoon
note), and, looking about them, they think themselves still on the
ground. &ldquo;The persistent <i>tremolo</i> of the double basses on one note may
be taken to mean that the two did not really leave the solid earth.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation VIII</span></h3>
<p>The Journey in the Enchanted Bark. Don Quixote sees an empty
boat, and he is sure it is sent by some mysterious power, that he may
do a glorious deed. He and Sancho embark. His typical theme is
changed into a barcarolle. The boat upsets, but they succeed in gaining
the shore; and they give thanks for their safety (wind instruments
<i>religioso</i>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation IX</span></h3>
<p>The Combat with Two Magicians. &ldquo;Quickly and stormily,&rdquo; D minor,
4-4. Don Quixote is again on his famous horse, eager for adventure.
Two peaceable monks are jogging along on their mules, and the Knight
sees in them the base magicians who have worked him harm. He
charges them and puts them to flight. The two themes are a version of
the Don Quixote motive and an ecclesiastical phrase for the bassoons.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Variation X</span></h3>
<p>Don Quixote, defeated by the Knight of the White Moon, returns
home and resolves to be a shepherd. &ldquo;Know, sir,&rdquo; said the Knight of
the White Moon, &ldquo;that I am styled the Bachelor Samson Carrasco, and
am one of Don Quixote&rsquo;s town; whose wild madness hath moved as
many of us as know him to compassion, and me amongst the rest
most; and believing that the best means to procure his health is to
keep him quiet, and so to have him in his own house, I thought upon
this device.&rdquo; So said this knight after the furious battle which is thus
described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They both of them set spurs to their horses, and the Knight of the
White Moon&rsquo;s being the swifter, met Don Quixote ere he had run a
quarter of his career so forcibly (without touching him with his lance,
for it seemed he carried it aloft on purpose) that he tumbled horse and
man both to the ground, and Don Quixote had a terrible fall; so he got
straight on the top of him; and, clapping his lance&rsquo;s point upon his
visor, said, &lsquo;You are vanquished, Knight, and a dead man, if you confess
not, according to the conditions of our combat.&rsquo; Don Quixote, all
bruised and amazed, without heaving up his visor, as if he had spoken
out of a tomb, with a faint and weak voice, said, &lsquo;Dulcinea del Toboso
is the fairest woman in the world, and I the unfortunatest Knight on
earth; and it is not fit that my weakness defraud this truth; thrust your
lance into me, Knight, and kill me, since you have bereaved me of
my honor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not so truly,&rsquo; quoth he of the White Moon, &lsquo;let the fame
of my Lady Dulcinea&rsquo;s beauty live in her entireness; I am only contented
that the grand Don Quixote retire home for a year, or till such
time as I please, as we agreed, before we began the battle.&rsquo; And Don
Quixote answered that, so nothing were required of him in prejudice
of his Lady Dulcinea, he would accomplish all the rest, like a true and
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
punctual knight.&rdquo; The variation portrays the fight. The pastoral theme
heard in the second variation&mdash;the battle with the sheep&mdash;reappears.
Don Quixote loses one by one his illusions.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Finale</span></h3>
<p>The Death of Don Quixote. &ldquo;Very peacefully,&rdquo; D major, 4-4. The
typical theme of the Knight takes a new form. The queer harmonies
in a section of this theme are now conventional, commonplace. &ldquo;They
stood all gazing one upon another, wondering at Don Quixote&rsquo;s sound
reasons, although they made some doubt to believe them. One of the
signs which induced them to conjecture that he was near unto death&rsquo;s
door was that with such facility he was from a stark fool become a
wise man. For, to the words already alleged, he added many more so
significant, so Christian-like, and so well couched, that without doubt
they confidently believed that Don Quixote was become a right wise
man.... These heavy news opened the sluices of the tears-ful and
swollen-blubbering eyes of the maid, of the niece, and of his good
Squire Sancho Panza; so that they showered forth whole fountains of
tears and fetched from the very bottom of their aggrieved hearts a
thousand groaning sighs. For in effect (as we have already declared
elsewhere) whilst Don Quixote was simply the good Alonso Quixano,
and likewise when he was Don Quixote de la Mancha, he was ever of
a mild and affable disposition and of a kind and pleasing conversation:
and therefore was he not only beloved of all his household, but also of
all those that knew him.... He had no sooner ended his discourse
and signed and sealed his will and testament, but a swooning and
faintness surprising him, he stretched himself the full length of his
bed. All the company were much distracted and moved thereat, and
ran presently to help him; and during the space of three days, that he
lived after he had made his will, he did swoon and fall into trances
almost every hour. All the house was in a confusion and uproar; all
which notwithstanding the niece ceased not to feed very devoutly: the
maidservant to drink profoundly, and Sancho to live merrily. For,
when a man is in hope to inherit anything, that hope doth deface or
at least moderate in the mind of the inheritor the remembrance or
feeling of the sorrow and grief which of reason he should have a feeling
of the testator&rsquo;s death. To conclude, the last day of Don Quixote
came, after he had received all the sacraments; and had by many and
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
godly reasons made demonstration to abhor all the books of errant
chivalry. The notary was present at his death and reporteth how he
had never read or found in any book of chivalry that any errant knight
died in his bed so mildly, so quietly, and so Christianly as did Don
Quixote. Amidst the wailful plaints and blubbering tears of the bystanders,
he yielded up the ghost, that is to say, he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tremolos in the strings indicate the first shiver of a deadly fever.&rdquo;
The Knight feels his end is near. Through the violoncello he speaks
his last words. He remembers his fancies; he recalls the dreams and the
ambitions; he realizes that they were all as smoke and vanity; he is,
indeed, ready to die.</p>
<h2 id="c143"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;EIN HELDENLEBEN&rdquo; (A HERO&rsquo;S LIFE), TONE POEM, OP. 40</span></h2>
<p>We doubt if <i>Ein Heldenleben</i> will be ranked among Strauss&rsquo;s
important works, though some of the sections, notably &ldquo;The Hero&rsquo;s
Escape from the World, and Conclusion&rdquo; are impressive, having
emotional depth, being the baring of a soul. No man is perhaps a
hero to his valet; but Strauss is evidently a hero to himself. He is
autobiographical in this tone poem, as in his <i>Domestic</i> symphony.
There is a certain presumption in asking one to hear musical descriptions
of a composer&rsquo;s struggles, his feelings at being adversely
criticized by wretched Philistines, who do not appreciate him, his
sulking and withdrawal, like Achilles to his tent. And why drag
Frau Strauss into the musical story and typify her, capricious,
coquettish, by whimsical measures for the violin? This tone poem,
in spite of the sections just referred to, might be justly entitled
&ldquo;A Poseur&rsquo;s Life,&rdquo; and a blustering poseur at that.</p>
<p>Still, in <i>Ein Heldenleben</i> there is the peaceful, contemplative
ending, pages that Strauss has seldom surpassed, only in the recognition
scene of <i>Elektra</i> and the presentation of the rose by the cavalier.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Ein Heldenleben</i>, a <i>Tondichtung</i>, was first performed at the eleventh
concert of the Museumsgesellschaft, Frankfort-on-the-Main, March 3,
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
1899, when Strauss conducted from manuscript and Alfred Hess played
the violin solo.</p>
<p>Strauss began the composition of this tone poem at Munich, August
2, 1898; he completed the score December 27, 1898, at Charlottenburg.
The score and parts were published at Leipsic in March, 1899.</p>
<p>The score calls for these instruments: sixteen first and second violins,
twelve violas, twelve violoncellos, eight double basses, two harps, a
piccolo, three flutes, three or four oboes, an English horn, clarinet in
E flat, two clarinets in B flat, bass clarinet, three bassoons, double
bassoon, eight horns, five trumpets, three trombones, a tenor tuba, a
bass tuba, kettledrums, bass drum, snare drum, side drum, cymbals.
It is dedicated to Willem Mengelberg and his orchestra in Amsterdam.
Strauss has said that he wrote <i>A Hero&rsquo;s Life</i> as a companion work to
his <i>Don Quixote</i>, Op. 35: &ldquo;Having in this later work sketched the
tragi-comic figure of the Spanish Knight whose vain search after
heroism leads to insanity, he presents in <i>A Hero&rsquo;s Life</i> not a single
poetical or historical figure, but rather a more general and free ideal
of great and manly heroism&mdash;not the heroism to which one can apply
an everyday standard of valor, with its material and exterior rewards,
but that heroism which describes the inward battle of life, and which
aspires through effort and renouncement towards the elevation of the
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many descriptions and explanations of <i>Ein Heldenleben</i>.
One of the longest and deepest&mdash;and thickest&mdash;is by Friedrich R&ouml;sch.
This pamphlet contains seventy thematical illustrations, as well as a
descriptive poem by Eberhard K&ouml;nig. Romain Rolland quotes Strauss
as saying: &ldquo;There is no need of a programme. It is enough to know
there is a hero fighting his enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work is in six sections:</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero</span></h3>
<p>The chief theme, which is typical of the hero, the whole and noble
man, is announced at once by horn, violas and violoncellos, and the
violins soon enter. This theme, E flat major, 4-4, is said to contain
within itself four distinct motives, which collectively illustrate the will
power and self-confidence of the hero, and their characteristic features
are used throughout the work in this sense. Further themes closely
related follow. They portray various sides of the hero&rsquo;s character&mdash;his
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
pride, emotional nature, iron will, richness of imagination, &ldquo;inflexible
and well-directed determination instead of low-spirited and sullen
obstinacy,&rdquo; etc. This section closes with pomp and brilliance, with the
motive thundered out by the brass; and it is the most symphonic
section of the tone poem. &ldquo;A pause is made on a dominant seventh:
&lsquo;What has the world in store for the young dreamer?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero&rsquo;s Antagonists</span></h3>
<p>They are jealous, they envy him, they sneer at his aims and endeavors,
they are suspicious of his sincerity, they see nothing except
for their own gain; and through flute and oboe they mock and snarl.
They are represented by about a half-a-dozen themes, of which one is
most important. Diminutions of the preceding heroic themes show
their belittlement of his greatness. (It has been said that Strauss thus
wished to paint the critics who had not been prudent enough to proclaim
him great.) &ldquo;Fifths in the tubas show their earthly, sluggish
nature.&rdquo; The hero&rsquo;s theme appears in the minor; and his amazement,
indignation, and momentary confusion are expressed by &ldquo;a timid,
writhing figure.&rdquo; Finally the foes are shaken off.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero&rsquo;s Helpmate</span></h3>
<p>This is an amorous episode. The hero is shy. The solo violin represents
the loved one, who at first is coy, coquettish, and disdains his
humble suit. There is a love theme, and there are also two &ldquo;thematic
illustrations of feminine caprice&rdquo; much used later on. At last she
rewards him. The themes given to the solo violin, and basses, violoncellos,
and bassoon, are developed in the love duet. A new theme is
given to the oboe, and a theme played by the violins is typical of the
crowning of happiness. The clamorous voices of the world do not mar
the peacefulness of the lovers.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero&rsquo;s Battlefield</span></h3>
<p>There is a flourish of trumpets without. The hero rushes joyfully
to arms. The enemy sends out his challenge. The battle rages. The
typical heroic theme is brought into sharp contrast with that of the
challenger, and the theme of the beloved one shines forth amid the
din and the shock of the fight. The foe is slain. The themes lead into
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
a song of victory. And now what is there for the hero? The world
does not rejoice in his triumph. It looks on him with indifferent eyes.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero&rsquo;s Mission of Peace</span></h3>
<p>This section describes the growth of the hero&rsquo;s soul. The composer
uses thematic material from <i>Don Juan</i>, <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i>, <i>Tod
und Verkl&auml;rung</i>, <i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s lustige Streiche</i>,
<i>Guntram</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, and his song, &ldquo;Traum durch die D&auml;mmerung.&rdquo;
Jean Marnold claims that there are twenty-three of these reminiscences,
quotations, which Strauss introduces suddenly, or successively, or
simultaneously, &ldquo;and the hearer that has not been warned cannot at
the time notice the slightest disturbance in the development. He would
not think that all these themes are foreign to the work he hears, and
are only souvenirs.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hero&rsquo;s Escape from the World, and Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>The world is still cold. At first the hero rages, but resignation and
content soon take possession of his soul. The bluster of nature reminds
him of his old days of war. Again he sees the beloved one, and in
peace and contemplation his soul takes flight. For the last time the
hero&rsquo;s theme is heard as it rises to a sonorous, impressive climax. And
then is solemn music, such as might serve funeral rites.</p>

<h2 id="c144"><span class="h2line1">IGOR FEDOROVITCH</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRAVINSKY</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Oranienbaum, near St. Petersburg, on June 5, 1882)</p>
<p>As for Stravinsky, we personally prefer the Stravinsky of the
<i>Sacre du Printemps</i> to the Stravinsky who of late has been attempting
to compose in the manner of Bach. To begin with, we do not
hear music now with the ears of the earlier centuries, and the old
idiom today has no pertinence except when it has been handed
down to us by a master of it, who broke through the idiom and
made a universal language of it for many years to come. Stravinsky&rsquo;s
feeble echo is simply dull, boresome. His &ldquo;Muscovism&rdquo; is
greatly to be preferred.</p>

<dd><span class="cn">VI. </span>Finale</dd></dl>
<p>In the summer of 1909 Diaghilev asked Stravinsky to write a ballet
founded on the old Russian legend of the Fire-Bird. The score was
ready in May, 1910. The scenario was the work of Fokine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>The first performance of <i>L&rsquo;Oiseau de Feu</i>, a <i>Conte dans&eacute;</i>, in two
scenes, was at the Paris <i>Op&eacute;ra</i> on June 25, 1910. The Fire-Bird, Tamara
Karsavina; The Beautiful Tsarevna, Mme Fokina; Ivan Tsarevitch,
Fokine; Kastche&iuml;, Boulgakov. Gabriel Piern&eacute; conducted. The stage
settings were by Golovine and Bakst. Balakirev had sketched an opera
in which the Fire-Bird was the central figure, but nothing came of it.
Kastche&iuml; (or Kostche&iuml;) is the hero of Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s opera
<i>Kastche&iuml; the Immortal: an Autumn Legend</i>, produced at the Private
Opera, Moscow, in 1902. He also figures as &ldquo;the man-skeleton&rdquo; in
Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s <i>Mlada</i>, a fairy opera-ballet (St. Petersburg, 1893)
and, by implication, Moussorgsky&rsquo;s symphonic poem, <i>A Night on Bald
Mountain</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Montagu-Nathan<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> says in his sketch of Stravinsky: &ldquo;In identifying
the literary basis of <i>The Fire-Bird</i> with that of Korsakov&rsquo;s
<i>Kastche&iuml;</i>, it should be pointed out that the latter work is but a <i>pastiche</i>
of episodes derived from legendary lore, with the monster as a central
figure. In Stravinsky&rsquo;s ballet, the ogre is an accessory character, so
far as concerns the dramatic action, but his presence in the scheme is
nevertheless vital to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ivan Tsarevich, the hero of many tales, wandering in the night,
espies the Fire-Bird attempting to pluck the golden fruit from a silver
tree, and, after a chase, succeeds in capturing her. But receiving the
gift of a glowing feather he consents to forego his prize. As the darkness
of night lifts, Ivan discovers that he is in the grounds of an old
castle, from which thirteen maidens presently emerge. They are observed
by the concealed youth to make play with the tree and its
fruit. Disclosing himself, he obtains possession of a golden apple. With
the approaching dawn the maidens withdraw into the castle, which
Ivan now recognizes as that of the fearsome Kastche&iuml;, captor of
decoyed travelers, over whom he tyrannously wields his magic power.
Ivan resolves upon entering Kastche&iuml;&rsquo;s abode, but on opening the gate
he is confronted first by a motley horde of freakish monsters and
then by the ogre himself, to whose court they belong. Kastche&iuml; seeks
to bewitch the young adventurer and to turn him to stone, but Ivan
is protected by the glowing feather. Presently the bird comes to his
aid and nullifies Kastche&iuml;&rsquo;s threatened spell, and, after demonstrating
its power by causing the frightful company of courtiers to break into
a frenzied dance, reveals the casket in which Kastche&iuml;&rsquo;s &lsquo;death&rsquo; is
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
hidden. From the casket Ivan takes an egg, which he dashes to the
ground; the death it contains unites itself with its owner, and the dread
wizard dies. His castle vanishes, his victims are liberated, and Ivan
receives the hand of the most beautiful of the maidens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The score, which was later revised with a smaller orchestration,

<p>The ballet <i>Petrouchka: Sc&egrave;nes burlesques en 4 Tableaux</i>, scenario
by Alexandre Benois, was completed by Stravinsky at Rome in May
(13-26), 1911. It was produced by Diaghilev at the Ch&acirc;telet, Paris,
on June 13, 1911. The chief dancers were Mme Tamar Karsavina, La
Ballerine; Nijinsky, Petrouchka. Mr. Monteux conducted; Mr. Fokine
was the ballet master. The scenery and costumes were designed by
Benois; the scenery was painted by Anisfeld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ballet depicts the life of the lower classes in Russia, with all
its dissoluteness, barbarity, tragedy, and misery. Petrouchka is a sort
of Polichinello, a poor hero always suffering from the cruelty of the
police and every kind of wrong and unjust persecution. This represents
symbolically the whole tragedy in the existence of the Russian people,
a suffering from despotism and injustice. The scene is laid in the midst
of the Russian carnival, and the streets are lined with booths in one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
which Petrouchka plays a kind of humorous r&ocirc;le. He is killed, but he
appears again and again as a ghost on the roof of the booth to frighten
his enemy, his old employer, an allusion to the despotic rules in
Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following description of the ballet is taken from <i>Contemporary
Russian Composers</i>, by Mr. Montagu-Nathan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;plot&rsquo; of <i>Petrouchka</i> owes nothing to folklore, but retains the
quality of the fantastic. Its chief protagonist is a lovelorn doll; but we
have still a villain in the person of the <i>focusnik</i>, a showman who for
his own ends prefers to consider that a puppet has no soul. The scene
is the Admiralty Square, St. Petersburg; the time &lsquo;Butter-Week,&rsquo; somewhere
about the eighteen-thirties.... Prior to the raising of the first
curtain the music has an expectant character and the varied rhythmic
treatment of a melodic figure which has a distinct folk-tune flavor has
all the air of inviting conjecture as to what is about to happen. Once
the curtain goes up we are immediately aware that we are in the
midst of a carnival, and are prepared for some strange sights. The
music describes the nature of the crowd magnificently, and in his
orchestral reproduction of a hurdy-gurdy, whose player mingles with
the throng, Stravinsky has taken pains that his orchestral medium shall
not lend any undue dignity to the instrument.... Presently the showman
begins to attract his audience, and, preparatory to opening his
curtain, plays a few mildly florid passages on his flute. With his final
flourish he animates his puppets. They have been endowed by the
showman with human feelings and passions. Petrouchka is ugly and
consequently the most sensitive. He endeavors to console himself for
his master&rsquo;s cruelty by exciting the sympathy and winning the love
of his fellow doll, the Ballerina, but in this he is less successful than
the callous and brutal Moor, the remaining unit in the trio of puppets.
Jealousy between Petrouchka and the Moor is the cause of the tragedy
which ends in the pursuit and slaughter of the former. The Russian
Dance which the three puppets perform at the bidding of their task-master
recalls vividly the passage of a crowd in Rimsky-Korsakov&rsquo;s
<i>Kitezh</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When at the end of the dance the light fails and the inner curtain
falls, we are reminded by the roll of the side drum which does duty
as entr&rsquo;acte music that we have to do with a realist, with a composer
who is no more inclined than was his precursor Dargomijsky to make
concessions; he prefers to preserve illusions, and so long as the drum
<span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
continues its slow fusillade the audience&rsquo;s mind is kept fixed upon the
doll it has been contemplating. The unsuccessful courtship is now
enacted and then the scene is again changed to the Moor&rsquo;s apartment,
where, after a monotonous droning dance, the captivation of the Ballerina
takes place. There are from time to time musical figures recalling
the showman&rsquo;s flute flourishes, apparently referring to his dominion
over the doll.... The scene ends with the summary ejection of that
unfortunate (Petrouchka), and the drum once more bridges the change
of scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the last tableau the Carnival, with its consecutive common chords,
is resumed. The nurses&rsquo; dance, which is of folk origin, is one of several
items of decorative music, some of them, like the episode of the man
with the bear, and the merchant&rsquo;s accordion, being fragmentary. With
the combined dance of the nurses, coachmen, and grooms, we have
again a wonderful counterpoint of the melodic elements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the fun is at its height, it is suddenly interrupted by
Petrouchka&rsquo;s frenzied flight from the little theater. He is pursued by
the Moor, whom the cause of their jealousy tries vainly to hold in
check. To the consternation of the spectators, Petrouchka is slain by a
stroke of the cruel Moor&rsquo;s sword, and a tap on the <i>tambour de Basque</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The showman, having demonstrated to the satisfaction of the gay
crowd that Petrouchka is only a doll, is left alone with the corpse, but
is not allowed to depart in absolute peace of mind. To the accompaniment
of a ghastly distortion of the showman&rsquo;s flute music the wraith
of Petrouchka appears above the little booth. There is a brief reference
to the carnival figure, then four concluding <i>pizzicato</i> notes, and the
drama is finished. From his part in outlining it we conclude that
Stravinsky is an artist whose lightness of touch equals that of Ravel,
whose humanity is as deep as Moussorgsky&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ballet calls for these instruments: four flutes (two interchangeable
with piccolo), four oboes (one interchangeable with English horn),
four clarinets (one interchangeable with bass clarinet), four bassoons
(one interchangeable with double bassoon), four horns, two trumpets
(one interchangeable with little trumpet, in D), two <i>cornets-&agrave;-pistons</i>,
three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, snare drum, <i>tambour de
Provence</i>, bass drum, tambourine, cymbals, triangle, glockenspiel,
xylophones, tam-tam, celesta (two and four hands), pianoforte, two
harps, strings. The score, dedicated to Alexandre Benois, was published
in 1912.</p>

<p><i>The Rite of Spring</i>, or more literally according to the Russian <i>Spring
Consecration</i>, scenery and costumes designed by Nicolas Roerich,
choreography by W. Nijinsky, was produced at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Champs
&Eacute;lys&eacute;es on May 29, 1913, by the Diaghilev Ballet Russe. Mr. Monteux
conducted. The chief dancers were M. Nijinsky and Mlle Piltz. The
performance, while it delighted some, incited howls of protest. The
hissing was violent, mingled with counter cheers, so that M. Astruc
ordered the lights turned up. The late Alfred Capu wrote a bitter article
published in <i>Le Figaro</i>, in which he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bluffing the idle rich of Paris through appeals to their snobbery is a
delightfully simple matter.... The process works out as follows:
Take the best society possible, composed of rich, simple-minded, idle
people. Then submit them to an intense r&eacute;gime of publicity. By pamphlets,
newspaper articles, lectures, personal visits and all other appeals
to their snobbery, persuade them that hitherto they have seen only
vulgar spectacles, and are at last to know what is art and beauty. Impress
them with cabalistic formul&aelig;. They have not the slightest notion
of music, literature, painting, and dancing; still, they have heretofore
seen under these names only a rude imitation of the real thing. Finally
assure them that they are about to see real dancing and hear real music.
<span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
It will then be necessary to double the prices at the theater, so great
will be the rush of shallow worshipers at this false shrine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Carl Van Vechten describes the scene in his book: <i>Music after
the Great War</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I attended the first performance in Paris of Stravinsky&rsquo;s anarchistic
(against the canons of academic art) ballet, <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, in
which primitive emotions are both depicted and aroused by a dependence
on barbarous rhythm in which melody and harmony, as even so
late a composer as Richard Strauss understands them, do not enter. A
certain part of the audience, thrilled by what it considered to be a
blasphemous attempt to destroy music as an art, and swept away with
wrath, began very soon after the rise of the curtain to whistle, to make
cat-calls, and to offer audible suggestions as to how the performance
should proceed. Others of us, who liked the music and felt that the principles
of free speech were at stake, bellowed defiance. It was war over art
for the rest of the evening, and the orchestra played on unheard, except
occasionally when a slight lull occurred. The figures on the stage danced
in time to music that they had to imagine they heard, and beautifully
out of rhythm with the uproar in the auditorium. I was sitting in a
box, in which I had rented one seat. Three ladies sat in front of me,
and a young man occupied the place behind me. He stood up during
the course of the ballet to enable himself to see more clearly. The intense
excitement under which he was laboring, thanks to the potent
force of the music, betrayed itself presently when he began to beat
rhythmically on the top of my head with his fists. My emotion was so
great that I did not feel the blows for some time. They were perfectly
synchronized with the beat of the music. When I did, I turned around.
His apology was sincere. We had both been carried beyond ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were five performances in Paris that season.</p>
<p>When this ballet was brought out at Drury Lane, London, on July
11, 1913, with Mr. Monteux conductor, it was thought advisable to send
a lecturer, Mr. Edwin Evans, in front of the curtain, to explain the ideas
underlying the ballet. At the end of the performance there was greater
applause than hissing.</p>
<p>The music of this ballet was performed for the first time in concert
form by an orchestra conducted by Mr. Monteux at one of his concerts
at the Casino de Paris in Paris on April 5, 1914, when it was enthusiastically
applauded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>And now <i>The Rite of Spring</i> is acclaimed by many as Stravinsky&rsquo;s
&ldquo;greatest work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orchestration is as follows: piccolo, 3 flutes (the third interchangeable
with a second piccolo), bass flute; five oboes (the fourth
interchangeable with English horn); small clarinet in E flat, three clarinets
and bass clarinet; three bassoons, two double bassoons; eight horns

<p>It is a pleasure to find an American composer of talent who is
willing to write music that is cheerful, not portentous; whose fancy
is delicate; who uses a large orchestra discreetly, not chiefly to
make a thunderous noise. Mr. Taylor for his inspiration went to a
book that for years has pleased children from the tender age to
that of white hair; he did not ransack the Grecian or the Scandinavian
mythology; he had no thesis, no exposition of colors; he
did not attempt to portray in music cave life and the rude rites of
primitive man. Nor did he strive painfully to be ultra-modern in
the French, Italian, or German manner. He remembered Lewis
Carroll&rsquo;s story. Pleasant and amusing musical thoughts came into
his head, and he expressed them musically, without laboring after
transliteration. Even his narration of the Jabberwock&rsquo;s fate is not
too realistic, and in this movement the measures that may be taken
to picture the peaceful scene while the hero waited &ldquo;with vorpal
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
sword&rdquo; in hand by the Tumtum tree the approach of the fearful
monster are charged with poetic beauty. Charming also is the
&ldquo;Dedication.&rdquo; The whole work shows genuine fancy, a gift of
expression in an individual manner. Whether without titles the
music would identify this or that episode is not to the point. The
suite is frankly programme music, but of the better kind; natural,
not pretentious; amusing, but as a man of talent amuses first himself,
then those who are privileged to be with him.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This suite, inspired by <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>, by Lewis Carroll
(Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, 1832-98), was written in 1917-19 for
flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, pianoforte, and strings. It was produced
in this form at a concert of the New York Chamber Music
Society in New York on February 18, 1919. The suite was then in three
movements. In September, 1921, Mr. Taylor began to revise the suite
for full orchestra. He added &ldquo;The Garden of Live Flowers.&rdquo; The first
performance of the revised work was by the New York Symphony
Orchestra in Brooklyn, March 10, 1923. The performance was repeated
in New York the following afternoon.</p>
<p>The score, dedicated &ldquo;To Katharine Moore Taylor from a difficult
son,&rdquo; calls for these instruments: three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes,
English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon,
four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, a set of three kettledrums,
snare drum, tambourine, cymbals, triangle, glockenspiel, xylophone,
pianoforte, and strings.</p>
<p>When the suite was produced by the Symphony Society of New York,
the programme contained a description by Mr. Taylor:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suite needs no extended analysis. It is based on Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s
immortal nonsense fairy tale, <i>Through the Looking-Glass and What
Alice Found There</i>, and the five pictures it presents will, if all goes
well, be readily recognizable to lovers of the book. There are four
movements, the first being subdivided into two connected parts.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Ia. Dedication</span></h3>
<p>Carroll precedes the tale with a charming poetical foreword, the first
stanza of which the music aims to express. It runs:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Child of the pure, unclouded brow</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>And dreaming eyes of wonder!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Though time be fleet, and I and thou</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>Are half a life asunder,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Thy loving smile will surely hail</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>The love gift of a fairy tale.</i></p>
</div>
<p>A simple song theme, briefly developed, leads to</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Ib. The Garden of Live Flowers</span></h3>
<p>(The score contains this extract from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Tiger Lily,&rsquo; said Alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, &lsquo;I wish you could talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We can talk,&rsquo; said the Tiger-Lily, &lsquo;when there&rsquo;s anybody worth
talking to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And can the flowers talk?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As well as you can,&rsquo; said the Tiger-Lily, &lsquo;and a great deal louder.&rsquo;&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after Alice had entered the looking-glass country she came to
a lovely garden in which the flowers were talking&mdash;in the words of the
Tiger-Lily, &ldquo;as well as you can, and a great deal louder.&rdquo; The music,
therefore, reflects the brisk chatter of the swaying, bright-colored denizens
of the garden.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">II. Jabberwocky</span></h3>
<p>This is the poem that so puzzled Alice, and which Humpty-Dumpty
finally explained to her. The theme of that frightful beast, the Jabberwock,
is first announced by the full orchestra. The clarinet then begins
the tale, recounting how on a &ldquo;brillig&rdquo; afternoon, the &ldquo;slithy toves did
gyre and gimble in the wabe.&rdquo; Muttered imprecations by the bassoon
warn us to &ldquo;beware the Jabberwock, my son.&rdquo; A miniature march signalizes
the approach of our hero, taking &ldquo;his vorpal sword in hand.&rdquo;
Trouble starts among the trombones&mdash;the Jabberwock is upon us. The
battle with the monster is recounted in a short and rather repellent
fugue, the double basses bringing up the subject and the hero fighting
back in the interludes. Finally his vorpal blade (really a xylophone)
goes &ldquo;snicker-snack&rdquo; and the monster, impersonated by the solo bassoon,
dies a lingering and convulsive death. The hero returns to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_342">342</span>
victorious strains of his own theme&mdash;&ldquo;O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!&rdquo;
The whole orchestra rejoices&mdash;the church bells are rung&mdash;alarums and
excursions.</p>
<p>Conclusion. Once more the &ldquo;slithy toves&rdquo; perform their pleasing
evolutions, undisturbed by the uneasy ghost of the late Jabberwock.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">III. Looking-Glass Insects</span></h3>
<p>(The score contains extracts from the dialogue of Alice and the gnat
&ldquo;about the size of a chicken&rdquo; about various insects, among them the
bread-and-butter-fly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what does it live on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Weak tea with cream in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Supposing it couldn&rsquo;t find any?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then it would die, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But that must happen very often,&rsquo; said Alice thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It always happens,&rsquo; said the gnat.&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we find the vociferous diptera that made such an impression
upon Alice&mdash;the Bee-elephant, the Gnat, the Rocking-horse-fly, the
Snap-dragon-fly, and the Bread-and-butter-fly. There are several themes,
but there is no use trying to decide which insect any one of them
stands for.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">IV. The White Knight</span></h3>
<p>(The score contains extracts from the conversation of the White
Knight, and an account of his leave-taking.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a toy Don Quixote, mild, chivalrous, ridiculous, and rather
touching. He carried a mouse-trap on his saddle-bow, &ldquo;because, if they
do come, I don&rsquo;t choose to have them running about.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t
ride very well, but he was a gentle soul, with good intentions. There
are two themes: the first, a sort of instrumental prance, being the
Knight&rsquo;s own conception of himself as a slashing, dare-devil fellow.
The second is bland, mellifluous, a little sentimental&mdash;much more like
the Knight as he really was. The first theme starts off bravely, but falls
out of the saddle before very long, and has to give way to the second.
The two alternate, in various guises, until the end, when the Knight
rides off, with Alice waving her handkerchief&mdash;he thought it would
encourage him if she did.</p>

<p class="center">(Born at Votkinsk, in the government of Viatka, Russia, May 7, 1840; died at St. Petersburg, November 6, 1893)</p>
<p>It is true that in more than one page of his symphonies Tchaikovsky
narrowly escapes the reproach of vulgarity; but the earnestness,
the sincerity of the speech makes its way even before the
development and the amplification make them seem inevitable.
The heart of Tchaikovsky was that of a little child; the brain was
that of a man weary of the world and all its vanities. And so we
have the singular phenomenon of na&iuml;vet&eacute;, accompanied by a super-refined
skill&mdash;and all this in the body and mind of a man fundamentally
oriental in his tastes and especially in his love of surprising
or monotonous rhythms and gorgeous colors. The very modernity
of Tchaikovsky, his closeness to us as the spokesman of the
things we think and dare not say&mdash;these qualities may war against
his lasting fame; but in our day and generation he is the supreme
interpreter by music of elemental and emotional thought. The
emptiness of life obsessed him, and in the expression of his thought
he is again the man of his period. When faith returns again to the
world, his music may be studied with interest and curiosity as an
important document in sociology. But in the present we are under
his mighty spell.</p>

<p>If Tchaikovsky had a programme in mind when he composed his
Fifth and Sixth symphonies, he never published it to the world;
but for the Fourth he wrote an elaborate one. Does the music
gain by it? To us the Fourth symphony is interesting because it
seems nearer to the Russian spirit and life as portrayed by Dostoivsky
than the later ones. Even the ornamentation, the
arabesques, that in another&rsquo;s music would seem as so many excrescences,
perhaps frivolous, are here in place. The neurotic, self-torturing
Tchaikovsky was for years obsessed by the thought of
death and the charnel house. Fate was to him not a word to be
associated only with the story of &OElig;dipus or Pelop&rsquo;s line. The
Fourth symphony is a personal document, revealing the man, as
his letters revealed him. It is easy to pick flaws in it; to dismiss it
as a suite, not a symphony; to complain of this or that; but the
music with its deep-rooted melancholy, its noisy attempt to forget
the inevitable end, its drunken hilarity, its dark and sinister sadness,
is not easily to be put aside, not easily to be forgotten.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Tchaikovsky composed this symphony during the winter of 1877-78.
He had lost interest in an opera, <i>Othello</i>, for which a libretto at his
own wish had been drafted by Stassov. The first draft was finished in
May, 1877. He began the instrumentation on August 23 of that year,
and finished the first movement September 24. He began work again
towards the end of November. The <i>andantino</i> was finished on December
27, the <i>scherzo</i> on January 1, 1878, and the <i>finale</i> on January 7, 1878.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<p>The first performance was at a symphony concert of the Russian
Musical Society, Moscow, February 22, 1878. Nicholas Rubinstein conducted.</p>
<p>The dedication of this symphony is as follows: &ldquo;<i>&Agrave; mon meilleur
ami</i>&rdquo; (To my best friend), and thereby hangs a tale.</p>
<p>This best friend was the widow Nadejda Filaretovna von Meck. Her
maiden name was Frolovsky. Born in the village Snamensk, government
of Smolensk, February 10, 1831, she married in 1848 an engineer,
and for some years knew poverty. Her courage did not give way; she
was a helpmeet for her husband, who finally became famous and successful.
In 1876 her husband died. She was left with eleven children
and a fortune of &ldquo;many millions of rubles.&rdquo; Dwelling at Moscow, fond
of music, she admired beyond measure certain works by Tchaikovsky.
Inquiring curiously concerning his character as a man and about his
worldly circumstances, she became acquainted with Kotek, a pupil of
Tchaikovsky in composition. Through him she gave Tchaikovsky commissions
for transcriptions for violin and pianoforte of some of his
works. There was an interchange of letters. In the early summer of
1877 she learned that he was in debt. She sent him 3,000 rubles; in
the fall of the same year she determined to give him yearly the sum of
6,000 rubles, that he might compose free from pecuniary care and vexation;
but she insisted that they should never meet. They never spoke
together; their letters were frequent and intimate. Tchaikovsky poured
out his soul to this woman, described by his brother Modeste as proud
and energetic, with deep-rooted principles, with the independence of
a man; a woman that held in disdain all that was petty and conventional;
pure in thought and action; a woman that was compassionate,
not sentimental.</p>
<p>The composer wrote to her on May 13, 1877, that he purposed to
dedicate this symphony to her. &ldquo;I believe that you will find in it echoes
of your deepest thoughts and feelings. At this moment any other work
would be odious to me; I speak only of work that presupposes the existence
of a determined mood. Added to this I am in a very nervous,
worried, and irritable state, highly unfavorable to composition, and even
my symphony suffers in consequence.&rdquo; In August, 1877, writing to her,
he referred to the symphony as &ldquo;yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;I hope it will please you, for
that is the main thing.&rdquo; He wrote in August from Kamenka: &ldquo;The first
movement has cost me much trouble in scoring it. It is very complicated
and long; but it seems to me it is also the most important. The

other movements are simple, and it will be fun to score them. There
will be a new effect of sound in the <i>scherzo</i>, and I expect much from
it. At first the strings play alone and <i>pizzicato</i> throughout. In the trio
the wood-wind instruments enter and play alone. At the end all three
choirs toss short phrases to each other. I believe that the effects of
sound and color will be most interesting.&rdquo; He wrote to her in December
from Venice that he was hard at work on the instrumentation:
&ldquo;No one of my orchestral pieces has cost me so much labor, but on no
one have I worked with so much love and with such devotion. At first
I was led on only by the wish to bring the symphony to an end, and
then I grew more and more fond of the task, and now I cannot bear
to leave it. My dear Nadejda Filaretovna, perhaps I am mistaken, but
it seems to me that this symphony is no mediocre piece; that it is the
best I have yet made. How glad I am that it is our work, and that you
will know when you hear it how much I thought about you in every
measure! If you were not, would it ever have been finished? When
I was in Moscow and thought that my end was about to come [There
is a reference here to the crazed condition of Tchaikovsky after his
amazing marriage to Antonina Ivanovna Milioukov. The wedding was
on July 18, 1877. He left his wife at Moscow, October 6, of that year.]
I wrote on the first draft: &lsquo;If I should die, please send this manuscript
to N. F. von Meck.&rsquo; I wished the manuscript of my last composition
to be in your possession. Now I am not only well, but, thanks to you,
in the position to give myself wholly to work, and I believe that I have
written music which cannot fall into oblivion. Yet it is possible that I
am wrong; it is the peculiar habit of all artists to wax enthusiastic over
the youngest of their productions.&rdquo; Later he had chills as well as fever
over the worth of the symphony.</p>

<p>Tchaikovsky was singularly reticent in his letters concerning the
Fifth symphony, but who can refrain from thinking with Ernest
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
Newman that this symphony was written to a programme; that
the work &ldquo;embodies an emotional sequence of some kind&rdquo;? There
is the tread of inexorable fate; this tread disturbs the beauty of the
<i>andante</i>; it checks the forced gayety of the dancers in the waltz,
and is the triumphant spirit in the <i>finale</i> something more than a
heroic defiance of the inevitable, a brave stand before the approach
of death?</p>
<p>We are interested in the woe of Canio or of the Navarraise; we
are moved by the infinite sadness of M&eacute;lisande; we understand the
tragedy in the humble home on Montmartre and the agony of
Rigoletto. We endure the spectacle of the anguish of these men
and women on the stage, applaud and go comfortably to bed.
Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s music awakens in the breast the haunting, unanswerable
questions of life and death that concern us directly and
personally.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>About the end of April, 1888, Tchaikovsky took possession of his
country house at Frolovskoe, which had been made ready for him,
when he was at Paris and London, by his servant Alexis. Frolovskoe
is a picturesque place on a wooded hill on the way from Moscow to
Klin. The house was simple. &ldquo;Here he [Tchaikovsky] could be alone,&rdquo;&mdash;we
quote from Mrs. Newmarch&rsquo;s translation into English of Modeste
Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s life of Peter,&mdash;&ldquo;free from summer excursionists, to enjoy
the little garden (with its charming pool and tiny islet) fringed by the
forest, behind which the view opened out upon a distant stretch of
country&mdash;upon that homely, unassuming landscape of Central Russia
which Tchaikovsky preferred to all the sublimities of Switzerland, the
Caucasus, and Italy. Had not the forest been gradually exterminated,
he would never have quitted Frolovskoe, for, although he only lived
there for three years, he became greatly attached to the place. A month
before his death, traveling from Klin to Moscow, he said, looking out
at the churchyard of Frolovskoe: &lsquo;I should like to be buried there.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 22 he wrote to Mme von Meck: &ldquo;Now I shall work my
hardest. I am exceedingly anxious to prove to myself, as to others, that
I am not played out as a composer.... Have I told you that I intend
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
to write a symphony? The beginning was difficult; but now inspiration
seems to have come. However, we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In July, Tchaikovsky received a letter from an American manager
who offered him 25,000 dollars for a concert tour of three months.
The sum seemed incredible to the composer: &ldquo;Should this tour really
take place, I could realize my long-cherished wish to become a landowner.&rdquo;
On August 6 he wrote to Mme von Meck: &ldquo;When I am old
and past composing, I shall spend the whole of my time in growing
flowers. I have been working with good results. I have orchestrated
half the symphony. My age&mdash;although I am not very old [he was then
forty-eight]&mdash;begins to tell on me. I become very tired, and I can no
longer play the pianoforte or read at night as I used to do.&rdquo; On August
26 he wrote to her: &ldquo;I am not feeling well, ... but I am so glad that
I have finished the symphony that I forget my physical troubles....
In November I shall conduct a whole series of my works in St. Petersburg,
at the Philharmonic, and the new symphony will be one of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fifth symphony was performed for the first time at St. Petersburg,
November 17, 1888. The composer conducted. The audience was
pleased, but the reviews in the newspapers were not very favorable.
On November 24 of the same year, Tchaikovsky conducted the symphony
again at a concert of the Musical Society.</p>
<p>In December, 1888, he wrote to Mme von Meck: &ldquo;After two performances
of my new symphony in St. Petersburg and one in Prague,
I have come to the conclusion that it is a failure. There is something
repellent, something superfluous, patchy, and insincere, which the public
instinctively recognizes. It was obvious to me that the ovations I
received were prompted more by my earlier work, and that the symphony
itself did not really please the audience. The consciousness of
this brings me a sharp twinge of self-dissatisfaction. Am I really played
out, as they say? Can I merely repeat and ring the changes on my
earlier idiom? Last night I looked through <i>our</i> symphony <a href="#c151">No. 4</a>.
What a difference! How immeasurably superior it is! It is very, very
sad!&rdquo; He was cheered by news of the success of the symphony in Moscow.</p>
<p>At the public rehearsal in Hamburg, the symphony pleased the
musicians; there was real enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky wrote after the concert to Davidov: &ldquo;The Fifth symphony
was magnificently played and I like it far better now, after having
<span class="pb" id="Page_349">349</span>
held a bad opinion of it for some time. Unfortunately, the Russian
press continues to ignore me. With the exception of my nearest and
dearest, no one will ever hear of my successes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Modeste Tchaikovsky is of the opinion that the Fifth symphony was
a long time in making its way chiefly on account of his brother&rsquo;s inefficiency
as a conductor.</p>
<p>The <i>andante</i>, E minor, 4-4 theme of the symphony, which occurs in
the four movements, typical of fate, &ldquo;the eternal note of sadness,&rdquo; of
what you will, is given at the very beginning to the clarinets, and the
development serves as an approach to the <i>allegro</i>. The principal theme
of the first movement, <i>allegro con anima</i>, 6-8, is announced by clarinet
and bassoon. It is developed elaborately and at great length. This theme
is said to have been derived from a Polish folk song. The second theme
in B minor is given to the strings. The recapitulation begins with the
restatement of the principal theme by the bassoon. There is a long
<i>coda</i>, which finally sinks to a <i>pianissimo</i> and passes to the original key.</p>
<p>The second movement has been characterized as a romance, firmly
knit together in form, and admitting great freedom of interpretation,
as the qualification, &ldquo;<i>con alcuna licenza</i>,&rdquo; of the <i>andante cantabile</i> indicates.
After a short introduction in the deeper strings, the horn sings
the principal melody. The oboe gives out a new theme, which is answered
by the horn, and this theme is taken up by violins and violas.
The principal theme is heard from the violoncellos, after which the
clarinet sings still another melody, which is developed to a climax, in
which the full orchestra thunders out the chief theme of the symphony,
the theme of bodement. The second part of the movement follows in
a general way along the lines already established. There is another
climax, and again is heard the impressive theme of the symphony.</p>
<p>The third movement is a waltz <i>allegro moderato</i>, A major, 3-4. The
structure is simple, and the development of the first theme, <i>dolce con
grazia</i>, given to violins against horns, bassoons, and string instruments,
is natural. Toward the very end clarinets and bassoons sound, as afar
off, the theme of the symphony: the gayety is over.</p>
<p>There is a long introduction, <i>andante maestoso</i>, E major, 4-4, to the
<i>finale</i>, a development of the somber and dominating theme. This
<i>andante</i> is followed by an <i>allegro vivace</i>, E minor, with the first theme
given to the strings, and a more tuneful theme assigned first to the
wood-wind and afterward to the violins. The development of the second
theme contains illusions to the chief theme of the symphony.
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
Storm and fury; the movement comes to a halt; the <i>coda</i> begins in
E major, the <i>allegro vivace</i> increases to a <i>presto</i>. The second theme of
the <i>finale</i> is heard, and the final climax contains a reminiscence of the
first theme of the first movement.</p>
<p>Some find pleasure in characterizing Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s symphonies as
suites; Dvo&#345;&aacute;k is said to have made this criticism. But the Fifth symphony
escapes this charge, for objectors admit that in this work the
composer made his nearest approach to true symphonic form&mdash;in spite
of the fact that there is no repetition of the first part of the first <i>allegro</i>,
and a waltz movement takes the place of the <i>scherzo</i>.</p>

<p>We well remember the sensation the Sixth symphony made in
Boston when Mr. Paur brought it out. When the late William
Foster Apthorp described the music as &ldquo;obscene,&rdquo; a singular word
to apply to it, indignant denunciatory letters were sent to the <i>Evening
Transcript</i>, written by persons who, as Charles Reade once
said of letter writers to newspapers, had no other waste-pipe for
their intellect.</p>
<p class="tb">This symphony was at the first so popular that some predicted
its life would be short. It is still an amazing human document. The
Fifth may for some reasons be preferred as a purely musical composition;
the Fourth has more of the Russian folk-spirit; but the
somber eloquence of the <i>Pathetic</i>, its pages of recollected joys fled
forever, its wild gayety quenched by the thought of the inevitable
end, its mighty lamentation&mdash;these are overwhelming and shake
the soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_351">351</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The first mention of the <i>Pathetic</i> symphony is in a letter from
Tchaikovsky to his brother Anatol, dated Klin, February 22, 1893: &ldquo;I
am now wholly occupied with the new work (a symphony) and it is
hard for me to tear myself away from it. I believe it comes into being
as the best of my works. I must finish it as soon as possible, for I have
to wind up a lot of affairs and I must also soon go to London. I told
you that I had completed a symphony which suddenly displeased me,
and I tore it up. Now I have composed a new symphony <i>which I certainly
shall not tear up</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning in August from a trip to London, Peter wrote to Modeste
that he was up to his neck in his symphony. &ldquo;The orchestration is the
more difficult, the farther I go. Twenty years ago I let myself write at
ease without much thought, and it was all right. Now I have become
cowardly and uncertain. I have sat the whole day over two pages; that
which I wished came constantly to naught. In spite of this, I make
progress.&rdquo; He wrote to Davidov, August 15: &ldquo;The symphony which
I intended to dedicate to you&mdash;I shall reconsider this on account of
your long silence&mdash;is progressing. I am very well satisfied with the
contents, but not wholly with the orchestration. I do not succeed in my
intentions. It will not surprise me in the least if the symphony is
cursed or judged unfavorably; &rsquo;twill not be for the first time. I myself
consider it the best, especially the most open-hearted of all my works.
I love it as I never have loved any other of my musical creations. My
life is without the charm of variety; evenings I am often bored; but
I do not complain, for the symphony is now the main thing, and I
cannot work anywhere so well as at home.&rdquo; He wrote Jurgenson, his
publisher, on August 24, that he had finished the orchestration: &ldquo;I give
you my word of honor that never in my life have I been so contented,
so proud, so happy, in the knowledge that I have written a good piece.&rdquo;
It was at this time that he thought seriously of writing an opera with
a text founded on <i>The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Mr. Barton</i>, by
George Eliot, of whose best works he was an enthusiastic admirer.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky left Klin forever on October 19. He stopped at Moscow
to attend a funeral, and there with Kashkin he talked freely after supper.
Friends had died; who would be the next to go? &ldquo;I told Peter,&rdquo;
said Kashkin, &ldquo;that he would outlive us all. He disputed the likelihood,
yet added that never had he felt so well and happy.&rdquo; Peter told
<span class="pb" id="Page_352">352</span>
him that he had no doubt about the first three movements of his new
symphony, but that the last was still doubtful in his mind; after the
performance he might destroy it and write another <i>finale</i>. He arrived
at St. Petersburg in good spirits, but he was depressed because the symphony
made no impression on the orchestra at the rehearsals. He
valued highly the opinion of players, and he conducted well only when
he knew that the orchestra liked the work. He was dependent on them
for the finesse of interpretation. &ldquo;A cool facial expression, an indifferent
glance, a yawn&mdash;these tied his hands; he lost his readiness of mind, he
went over the work carelessly, and cut short the rehearsal, that the
players might be freed from their boresome work.&rdquo; Yet he insisted that
he never had written and never would write a better composition than
this symphony.</p>
<p>The Sixth symphony was performed for the first time at St. Petersburg,
October 28, 1893. Tchaikovsky conducted. The symphony failed.
&ldquo;There was applause,&rdquo; says Modeste, &ldquo;and the composer was recalled,
but with no more enthusiasm than on previous occasions. There was
not the mighty, overpowering impression made by the work when it
was conducted by Napravnik, November 18, 1893, and later, wherever
it was played.&rdquo; The critics were decidedly cool.</p>
<p>The morning after, Modeste found Peter at the tea-table with the
score of the symphony in his hand. He regretted that, inasmuch as he
had to send it that day to the publisher, he had not yet given it a title.
He wished something more than &ldquo;No. 6,&rdquo; and did not like &ldquo;Programme
symphony.&rdquo; &ldquo;What does Programme symphony mean when
I will give it no programme?&rdquo; Modeste suggested &ldquo;Tragic,&rdquo; but Peter
said that would not do. &ldquo;I left the room before he had come to a
decision. Suddenly I thought, &lsquo;Pathetic.&rsquo; I went back to the room,&mdash;I
remember it as though it were yesterday,&mdash;and I said the word to
Peter. &lsquo;Splendid, Modi, bravo, &ldquo;Pathetic&rdquo;!&rsquo; and he wrote in my presence
the title that will forever remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On November 1, Tchaikovsky was in perfect health. He dined with
an old friend and went to the theater. In the cloakroom there was talk
about spiritualism. Varlamov objected to all talk about ghosts and anything
that reminded one of death. Tchaikovsky laughed at Varlamov&rsquo;s
manner of expression and said: &ldquo;There is still time enough to become
acquainted with this detestable snub-nosed one. At any rate, he will not
have us soon. I know that I shall live for a long time.&rdquo; He then went
with friends to a restaurant, where he ate macaroni and drank white
<span class="pb" id="Page_353">353</span>
wine with mineral water. When he walked home about 2 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, Peter
was well in body and in mind.</p>
<p>There are some who find pleasure in the thought that the death of a
great man was in some way mysterious or melodramatic. For years
some insisted that Salieri caused Mozart to be poisoned. There was a
rumor after Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s death that he took poison or sought deliberately
the cholera. When Mr. Alexander Siloti, a pupil of Tchaikovsky,
first visited Boston, in 1898, he did not hesitate to say that
there might be truth in the report, and, asked as to his own belief,
he shook his head with a portentous gravity that Burleigh might have
envied. We have been assured by other Russians who knew Tchaikovsky
that he killed himself, nor was the reason for his so doing withheld.
Peter&rsquo;s brother Modeste gives a circumstantial account of Peter&rsquo;s death
from natural causes. Peter awoke November 2 after a restless night, but
he went out about noon to make a call; he returned to luncheon, ate
nothing, and drank a glass of water that had not been boiled. Modeste
and others were alarmed, but Peter was not disturbed, for he was less
afraid of the cholera than of other diseases. Not until night was there
any thought of serious illness, and then Peter said to his brother: &ldquo;I
think this is death. Good-bye, Modi.&rdquo; At eleven o&rsquo;clock that night it
was determined that his sickness was cholera.</p>
<p>Modeste tells at length the story of Peter&rsquo;s ending. Their mother
had died of cholera in 1854, at the very moment that she was put into
a bath. The physicians recommended as a last resort a warm bath for
Peter, who, when asked if he would take one, answered: &ldquo;I shall be
glad to have a bath, but I shall probably die as soon as I am in the
tub&mdash;as my mother died.&rdquo; The bath was not given that night, the
second night after the disease had been determined, for Peter was too
weak. He was at times delirious, and he often repeated the name of
Mme von Meck in reproach or in anger, for he had been sorely hurt
by her sudden and capricious neglect after her years of interest and
devotion. The next day the bath was given. A priest was called, but it
was not possible to administer the Communion, and he spoke words
that the dying man could no longer understand. &ldquo;Peter Ilitch suddenly
opened his eyes. There was an indescribable expression of unclouded
consciousness. Passing over the others standing in the room, he looked
at the three nearest him, and then toward heaven. There was a certain
light for a moment in his eyes, which was soon extinguished, at the
same time with his breath. It was about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_354">354</div>
<p>What was the programme in Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s mind? Kashkin says
that, if the composer had disclosed it to the public, the world would
not have regarded the symphony as a kind of legacy from one filled
with a presentiment of his own approaching end; that it seems more
reasonable &ldquo;to interpret the overwhelming energy of the third movement
and the abysmal sorrow of the <i>finale</i> in the broader light of a
national or historical significance rather than to narrow them to the
expression of an individual experience. If the last movement is intended
to be predictive, it is surely of things vaster and issues more
fatal than are contained in a mere personal apprehension of death. It
speaks rather of a &lsquo;<i>lamentation large et souffrance inconnue</i>,&rsquo; and seems
to set the seal of finality on all human hopes. Even if we eliminate the
purely subjective interest, this autumnal inspiration of Tchaikovsky, in
which we hear &lsquo;the ground whirl of the perished leaves of hope, still
remains the most profoundly stirring of his works.&rsquo; ...&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c154"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;ROMEO AND JULIET,&rdquo; OVERTURE FANTASIA (AFTER SHAKESPEARE)</span></h2>
<p>The <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> overture would be worth a journey if
only to hear Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s love music. Here is the incomparable
expression in tones of the Southern passion of Juliet, and it is
strangely Shakespearean. The remainder of the overture is rather
rank Russian, with the exception of the music of Friar Laurence
and the noble requiem at the end.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This overture fantasia was begun and completed in 1869. The first
performance was at a concert of the Musical Society, Moscow, on March
16, 1870; Nicholas Rubinstein conducted. The work was revised in the
summer of 1870 during a sojourn in Switzerland; it was published in
1871. Tchaikovsky, not satisfied with it, made other changes, and, it is
said, shortened the overture. The second edition, published in 1881,
contains these alterations.</p>
<p>The first performance in the United States was in New York, by the
Philharmonic Society, George Matzka, conductor, on April 22, 1876.</p>
<p>The overture begins <i>andante non tanto, quasi moderato</i>, F sharp
<span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
minor, 4-4. Clarinets and bassoons sound the solemn harmonies, which,
according to Kashkin, characterize Friar Laurence; and yet Hermann
Teibler finds this introduction symbolical of &ldquo;the burden of fate.&rdquo; A
short theme creeps among the strings. There is an organ-point on D flat,
with modulation to F minor (flutes, horns, harp, lower strings). The
Friar Laurence theme is repeated (flutes, oboes, clarinets, English horn,
with <i>pizzicato</i> bass). The ascending cry of the flutes is heard in E minor
instead of F minor, as before.</p>
<p><i>Allegro giusto</i>, B minor, 4-4. The two households from &ldquo;ancient
grudge break to new mutiny.&rdquo; Wood-wind, horn, and strings picture
the hatred and fury that find vent in street brawls. A brilliant passage
for strings is followed by a repetition of the strife music. Then comes
the first love theme, D flat major (muted violas and English horn,
horns in syncopated accompaniment, with strings <i>pizzicato</i>). This
motive is not unlike in mood, and at times in melodic structure,
Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s famous melody, <i>Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt</i> (Op. 6,
No. 6), which was composed in December, 1869. In the &ldquo;Duo from
Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; found among Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s sketches and orchestrated
by S. Taneiev, this theme is the climax, the melodic phrase which
Romeo sings to &ldquo;<i>O nuit d&rsquo;extase, arr&ecirc;te-toi! O nuit d&rsquo;amour, &eacute;tends ton
voile noir sur nous!</i>&rdquo; (O tarry, night of ecstasy! O night of love,
stretch thy dark veil over us!). Divided and muted violins, with violas
<i>pizzicato</i>, play delicate, mysterious chords (D flat major), which in the
duet above mentioned serve as accompaniment to the amorous dialogue
of Romeo and Juliet in the chamber scene. Flutes and oboes take up
the first love theme.</p>
<p>There is a return to tumult and strife. The theme of dissension is
developed at length; the horns intone the Friar Laurence motive. The
strife theme at last dominates <i>fortissimo</i>, until there is a return to the
mysterious music of the chamber scene (oboes and clarinets, with murmurings
of violins and horns). The song grows more and more passionate,
until Romeo&rsquo;s love theme breaks out, this time in D major,
and is combined with the strife theme and the motive of Friar Laurence
in development. A burst of orchestral fury; there is a descent to
the depths; violoncellos, basses, bassoons, alone are heard; they die on
low F sharp, with roll of kettledrums. Then silence.</p>
<p><i>Moderato assai</i>, B minor. Drum beats, double basses <i>pizzicato</i>. Romeo&rsquo;s
song in lamentation. Soft chords (wood-wind and horns) bring
the end.</p>

<p>There was an old Grecian gentleman who apologized for the
sumptuous funeral provided for his little child. There are men who
have built a lordly portico for a dwelling place, and then, for some
reason or other, lack of funds or through caprice, contented themselves
with a tasteless, shabbily furnished mansion. The opening
section of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s piano concerto has a compelling melodic
sentence, treated gorgeously, and with magnificent breadth and
sweep. What follows is a curious mixture of engrossing measures
and wild vulgarity.</p>
<p>Perhaps Nicholas Rubinstein was right; after all, in his bitter,
almost venomous tirade when Tchaikovsky played it to him in
private. When the concerto was brought out in Boston by B&uuml;low,
in October, 1875&mdash;it was the very first performance&mdash;a critic of this
city shrewdly discovered that the first movement was &ldquo;not in the
classical concerto spirit.&rdquo; Tchaikovsky himself was amused by
American reviews sent to him by B&uuml;low. Peter wrote: &ldquo;The Americans
think that the first movement of my concerto &lsquo;suffers in consequence
of the absence of a central idea&rsquo;&mdash;and in the <i>finale</i> this
reviewer has found &lsquo;syncopation in trills, spasmodic pauses in the
theme, and disturbing octave passages!&rsquo; Think what healthy appetites
these Americans must have: each time B&uuml;low was obliged to
repeat the whole <i>finale</i> of my concerto! Nothing like this happens
in our country!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>In 1874 Tchaikovsky was a teacher of theory at the Moscow Conservatory.
(He began his duties at that institution in 1866 at a salary
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
of thirty dollars a month.) On December 13, 1874, he wrote to his
brother Anatol: &ldquo;I am wholly absorbed in the composition of a pianoforte
concerto, and I am very anxious that Rubinstein [Nicholas]
should play it in his concert. I make slow progress with the work, and
without real success; but I stick fast to my principles, and cudgel my
brain to subtilize pianoforte passages: as a result I am somewhat nervous,
so that I should much like to make a trip to Kiev for the purpose
of diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orchestration of the concerto was finished on February 21,
1875, but before that date he played the work to Nicholas Rubinstein.
The episode is one of the most singular in the history of this strangely
sensitive composer. He described it in a letter written to Nadeshda
Filaretovna von Meck. This letter is dated San Remo, February 2,
1878. It has been published in Modeste Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Life of his
famous brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In December, 1874, I had written a pianoforte concerto. As I am
not a pianist, I thought it necessary to ask a virtuoso what was technically
unplayable in the work, thankless, or ineffective. I needed the
advice of a severe critic who at the same time was friendly disposed
toward me. Without going too much into detail, I must frankly say
that an interior voice protested against the choice of Nicholas Rubinstein
as a judge over the mechanical side of my work. But he was the
best pianist in Moscow, and also a most excellent musician. I was
told that he would take it ill from me if he should learn that I had
passed him by and shown the concerto to another; so I determined
to ask him to hear it and criticize the pianoforte part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Christmas Eve, 1874, we were all invited to Albrecht&rsquo;s, and
Nicholas asked me, before we should go there, to play the concerto
in a classroom of the Conservatory. We agreed to it. I took my manuscript,
and Nicholas and Hubert came. Hubert is a mighty good and
shrewd fellow, but he is not a bit independent; he is garrulous and
verbose; he must always make a long preface to &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo;; he is not
capable of expressing an opinion in decisive, unmistakable form; and
he is always on the side of the stronger, whoever he may chance to
be. I must add that this does not come from cowardice, but only from
natural instability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I played through the first movement. Not a criticism, not a word.
You know how foolish you feel, if you invite one to partake of a meal
provided by your own hands, and the friend eats and&mdash;is silent! &lsquo;At
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
least say something, scold me good-naturedly, but for God&rsquo;s sake
speak, only speak, whatever you may say.&rsquo; Rubinstein said nothing. He
was preparing his thunderstorm; and Hubert was waiting to see how
things would go before he should jump to one side or the other. The
matter was right here: I did not need any judgment on the artistic form
of my work: there was question only about mechanical details. This
silence of Rubinstein said much. It said to me at once: &lsquo;Dear friend,
how can I talk about details when I dislike your composition as a
whole?&rsquo; But I kept my temper and played the concerto through. Again
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; I said, and stood up. Then burst forth from Rubinstein&rsquo;s
mouth a mighty torrent of words. He spoke quietly at first; then he
waxed hot, and at last he resembled Zeus hurling thunderbolts. It
appeared that my concerto was utterly worthless, absolutely unplayable;
passages were so commonplace and awkward that they could not
be improved; the piece as a whole was bad, trivial, vulgar. I had stolen
this from that one and that from this one; so only two or three pages
were good for anything, while the others should be wiped out or
radically rewritten. &lsquo;For instance, that! What is it, anyhow?&rsquo; (And
then he caricatured the passage on the pianoforte.) &lsquo;And this? Is it
possible?&rsquo; and so on, and so on. I cannot reproduce for you the main
thing, the tones in which he said all this. An impartial bystander
would necessarily have believed that I was a stupid, ignorant, conceited
note-scratcher, who was so impudent as to show his scribble to a celebrated
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hubert was staggered by my silence, and he probably wondered
how a man who had already written so many works and was a teacher
of composition at the Moscow Conservatory could keep still during
such a moral lecture or refrain from contradiction&mdash;a moral lecture
that no one should have delivered to a student without first examining
carefully his work. And then Hubert began to annotate Rubinstein;
that is, he incorporated Rubinstein&rsquo;s opinions, but sought to clothe
in milder words what Nicholas had harshly said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky erased the name of Nicholas Rubinstein from the score
and inserted in the dedication the name of Hans von B&uuml;low, whom he
had not yet seen; but Klindworth had told him of B&uuml;low&rsquo;s interest in
his works and his efforts to make them known in Germany. B&uuml;low
acknowledged the compliment, and in a warm letter of thanks praised
the concerto, which he called the &ldquo;fullest&rdquo; work by Tchaikovsky yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
known to him: &ldquo;The ideas are so original, so noble, so powerful; the
details are so interesting, and though there are many of them they do
not impair the clearness and the unity of the work. The form is so
mature, ripe, distinguished for style, for intention and labor are everywhere
concealed. I should weary you if I were to enumerate all the
characteristics of your work&mdash;characteristics which compel me to congratulate
equally the composer as well as all those who shall enjoy
actively or passively (respectively) the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time Tchaikovsky was sore in heart, wounded by his
friend. In 1878 Nicholas had the manliness to confess his error; as a
proof of his good-will he studied the concerto and played it often and
brilliantly in Russia and beyond the boundaries, as at the Paris Exhibition
of 1878.</p>

<p>Hanslick&rsquo;s volumes of collected reviews and essays are many. It
is possible that in the days to come he will be remembered only by
the fact that he said, apropos of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s violin concerto,
that it stank in the ear. In spite of Hanslick&rsquo;s dictum, the concerto
still lives, whatever its obvious faults: its endless repetitions, its
measures of sheer padding. Why cannot someone arrange <i>Gems
from Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Concerto</i> after the manner of various anthologies
(including <i>Crumbs of Comfort</i>)? Long-winded, tedious at
times as it is, the concerto, by reason of melodic charm and
demoniacal spirit, is still heard by the people gladly.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The concerto, dedicated at first to Leopold Auer, but afterwards to
Adolf Brodsky&mdash;and thereby hangs a tale&mdash;was performed for the first
time at a Philharmonic concert, Vienna, December 4, 1881. Brodsky
was the solo violinist. An interesting letter from him to Tchaikovsky
after the first performance, is published in Modeste&rsquo;s Life of his brother
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
(Vol. II, p. 177): &ldquo;I had the wish to play the concerto in public ever
since I first looked it through. That was two years ago. I often took it
up and often put it down, because my laziness was stronger than my
wish to reach the goal. You have, indeed, crammed too many difficulties
into it. I played it last year in Paris to Laroche, but so badly that he
could gain no true idea of the work; nevertheless, he was pleased with
it. That journey to Paris which turned out unluckily for me&mdash;I had to
bear many rude things from Colonne and Pasdeloup&mdash;fired my energy
(misfortune always does this to me, but when I am fortunate then am
I weak) so that, back in Russia, I took up the concerto with burning
zeal. It is wonderfully beautiful. One can play it again and again and
never be bored; and this is a most important circumstance for the conquering
of its difficulties. When I felt myself sure of it, I determined
to try my luck in Vienna. Now I come to the point where I must say
to you that you should not thank me: I should thank you; for it was
only the wish to know the new concerto that induced Hans Richter
and later the Philharmonic Orchestra to hear me play and grant my
participation in one of these concerts. The concerto was not liked at
the rehearsal of the new pieces, although I came out successfully on its
shoulders. It would have been most unthankful on my part, had I not
strained every nerve to pull my benefactor through behind me. Finally
we were admitted to the Philharmonic concert. I had to be satisfied
with one rehearsal, and much time was lost there in the correction of
the parts, that swarmed with errors. The players determined to accompany
everything <i>pianissimo</i>, not to go to smash; naturally, the work,
which demands many nuances, even in the accompaniment, suffered
thereby. Richter wished to make some cuts, but I did not allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concerto came immediately after a <i>divertimento</i> by Mozart.
According to the account of the Viennese critics and of Brodsky there
was a furious mixture of applause and hissing after the performance.
The applause prevailed, and Brodsky was thrice recalled, which showed
that the hissing was directed against the work, not the interpreter. Out
of ten critics only two, and they were the least important, reviewed the
concerto favorably. The review by Eduard Hanslick, who was born
hating programme music and the Russian school, was extravagant in
its bitterness, and caused Tchaikovsky long-continued distress, although
Brodsky, Carl Halir, and other violinists soon made his concerto
popular. Tchaikovsky wrote from Rome, December 27, 1881, to Jurgenson:
&ldquo;My dear, I saw lately in a caf&eacute; a number of the <i>Neue Freie Presse</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_361">361</span>
in which Hanslick speaks so curiously about my violin concerto that I
beg you to read it. Besides other reproaches he censures Brodsky for
having chosen it. If you know Brodsky&rsquo;s address, please write to him
that I am moved deeply by the courage shown by him in playing so
difficult and ungrateful a piece before a most prejudiced audience. If
Kotek, my best friend, were so cowardly and pusillanimous as to
change his intention of acquainting the St. Petersburg public with this
concerto, although it was his pressing duty to play it, for he is responsible
in the matter of ease of execution of the piece; if Auer, to
whom the work is dedicated, intrigued against me, so am I doubly
thankful to dear Brodsky, in that for my sake he must stand the curses
of the Viennese journals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The review of Hanslick is preserved in the volume of his collected
<i>feuilletons</i> entitled, <i>Concerte, Componisten, und Virtuosen der Letzten
f&uuml;nfzehn Jahre, 1870-1885</i>, pp. 295, 296 (Berlin, 1886). The criticism
in its fierce extravagance now seems amusing. Here are extracts: &ldquo;For
a while the concerto has proportion, is musical, and is not without
genius, but soon savagery gains the upper hand and lords it to the end
of the first movement. The violin is no longer played: it is yanked
about, it is torn asunder, it is beaten black and blue. I do not know
whether it is possible for anyone to conquer these hair-raising difficulties,
but I do know that Mr. Brodsky martyrized his hearers as well
as himself. The <i>adagio</i>, with its tender national melody, almost conciliates,
almost wins us. But it breaks off abruptly to make way for a
<i>finale</i> that puts us in the midst of the brutal and wretched jollity of a
Russian <i>kermess</i>. We see wild and vulgar faces, we hear curses, we
smell bad brandy. Friedrich Vischer once asserted in reference to
lascivious painting that there are pictures which &lsquo;stink in the eye.&rsquo;
Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s violin concerto brings to us for the first time the horrid
idea that there may be music that stinks in the ear.&rdquo; Modeste Tchaikovsky
tells us that this article disquieted Peter till he died; that he
knew it by heart, as he did an adverse criticism written by C&eacute;sar Cui
in 1866.</p>
<p>The concerto was dedicated first to Leopold Auer. Tchaikovsky, in
the Diary of his tour in 1888, wrote: &ldquo;I do not know whether my
dedication was flattering to Mr. Auer, but in spite of his genuine
friendship he never tried to conquer the difficulties of this concerto.
He pronounced it impossible to play, and this verdict, coming from
such an authority as the St. Petersburg virtuoso, had the effect of casting
<span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
this unfortunate child of my imagination for many years to come
into the limbo of hopelessly forgotten things.&rdquo; The composer about
seven years before this wrote to Jurgenson from Rome (January 16,
1882) that Auer had been &ldquo;intriguing against him.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s brother
Modeste explains this by saying: &ldquo;It had been reported to Peter that
Auer had dissuaded Emile Sauret from playing the concerto in St.
Petersburg;&rdquo; but Modeste also adds that Auer changed his opinion many
years later, and became one of the most brilliant interpreters of the
concerto.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following orchestration was used by Tchaikovsky in his last three symphonies
(with no percussion but timpani in the Fifth): piccolo, two flutes, two
oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, bass
tuba, kettledrums, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and strings. In the <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> overture, the English horn and harp were added for color, and the bass drum
(with the customary kettledrums) sufficed for percussion. In the piano and violin
concertos there was the same scheme of orchestration (without the additional
percussion).&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<h2 id="c157"><span class="h2line1">RICHARD</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WAGNER</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Leipsic, May 22, 1813; died at Venice, February 13, 1883)</p>
<p>It is not easy for anyone who did not live through the period
of the Wagnerian excitement to understand the fierceness of the
controversy. The younger generation reads at its ease accounts of
protests against compositions by Strauss, Reger, Sch&ouml;nberg; how
this or that piece was hissed by some in a concert hall and applauded
by others; it reads and is amused, but it regards the discussion
as academic. The Wagner question, like the Beecher trial,
like the Ibsen controversy in Norway, divided households.</p>
<p>The world has moved since 1876. Much water has flowed under
the bridge. Wagner is still one of the most commanding figures in
the temple, but it is no longer an act of irreverence to discuss him
as Verdi, Gluck, Richard Strauss are discussed. It is now generally
agreed that this towering genius was after all a mortal; that he was
often verbose, that he could be dull in his musical speech, as other
geniuses were before him.</p>
<p>The great public today cares nothing about Wagner&rsquo;s philosophy,
or the &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; of his <i>Ring</i>. Wotan, Mime, Siegfried, and the
rest of them, heroic or shabby characters, are as Radames, Salome,
M&eacute;lisande, Edgardo, Leonora, Manrico in the tower; they are persons
in a drama who sing, and do not speak the dialogue. We have
the heartiest admiration for the great scenes in the <i>Ring</i>, and yet
find Wotan long-winded and tiresome in his reminiscences and
<span class="pb" id="Page_364">364</span>
narrations. Mime is like Artemus Ward&rsquo;s kangaroo, &ldquo;an amoozin&rsquo;
little cuss.&rdquo; Alberich with his gibbering and his jumping about is
also amusing. The Dragon and the Bird do not excite our ridicule.
We accept them and find their singing no more surprising than
the vocal endurance of Tristan on his deathbed or the moving
scenery in the first act of <i>Parsifal</i>. The dragon is a familiar figure
in art, and we should not rub our eyes more than once if we
should see one in the wilds of New Jersey. We enjoy seeing him
in his proper place in <i>Siegfried</i> and do not wish to be told what he
represents or typifies.</p>
<p>Enemies of Wagner, esthetic enemies, used to reproach him for
the &ldquo;immorality&rdquo; of his librettos. In <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> there is the Venusberg.
In <i>Die Walk&uuml;re</i> there is the incestuous and adulterous pair
whose amorous shoutings shocked Arthur Schopenhauer. Reading
the story of <i>Tristan</i>, these rigid moralists held the nose and called
for civet. Fie on Kundry&rsquo;s case!</p>
<p>We now hear little about the &ldquo;immorality&rdquo; of the music dramas.
King Mark&rsquo;s long harangue is more immoral than the rapturous
duet of the lovers; the Landgrave is more immoral than Venus;
for Mark and the Landgrave, by reason of their long-winded
platitudes, make Virtue boresome and Respectability a monster.</p>
<p>And in the expression of certain emotions and passions, in the
expression of amorous ecstasy and the mystery of death, Wagner
reached a height of eloquence that has seldom been attained by
makers of music. Hearing the announcement by Br&uuml;nnhilde of
Siegmund&rsquo;s fate, the love song of Tristan and Isolde under the
cloak of the conniving night, the rustle and murmur of Siegfried&rsquo;s
forest, we marvel at the genius of the man who first heard these
things and had the ability to let the world hear them with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">365</div>
<h2 id="c158"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO &ldquo;RIENZI, THE LAST OF THE TRIBUNES&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The overture to <i>Rienzi</i> is at the best mere circus music. It is a
good thing to hear it once in a while, for it shows that Wagner, on
occasion, could be more vulgar than Meyerbeer, whom he so cordially
disliked.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>Wagner left K&ouml;nigsberg in the early summer of 1837 to visit Dresden,
and there he read B&auml;rmann&rsquo;s translation into German of Bulwer&rsquo;s
<i>Rienzi</i>. And thus was revived his long-cherished idea of making the
last of the Tribunes the hero of a grand opera. &ldquo;My impatience with
a degrading plight now amounted to a passionate craving to begin
something grand and elevating, no matter if it involved the temporary
abandonment of any practical goal. This mood was fed and strengthened
by a reading of Bulwer&rsquo;s <i>Rienzi</i>. From the misery of modern private
life, whence I could nohow glean the scantiest material for artistic
treatment, I was wafted by the image of a great historico-political event
in the enjoyment whereof I needs must find a distraction lifting me
above cares and conditions that to me appeared nothing less than absolutely
fatal to art.&rdquo; The overture to <i>Rienzi</i> was completed October 23,
1840. The opera was produced at the Royal Saxon Court Theater,
Dresden, October 20, 1842.</p>
<p>The overture is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, serpent (third bassoon), two valve horns, two
plain horns, two valve trumpets, two plain trumpets, three trombones,
one ophicleide, kettledrums, two snare drums, bass drum, triangle,
cymbals, and strings. The serpent mentioned in the score is replaced
by the double bassoon, and the ophicleide by the bass tuba.</p>
<p>All the themes of the overture are taken from the opera itself. The
overture begins with a slow introduction, <i>molto sostenuto e maestoso</i>,
D major, 4-4. It opens with &ldquo;a long-sustained, swelled and diminished
A on the trumpet,&rdquo; in the opera, the agreed signal for the uprising
of the people to throw off the tyrannical yoke of the nobles.
The majestic <i>cantilena</i> of the violins and the violoncellos is the theme
of Rienzi&rsquo;s prayer in the fifth act. The last prolonged A leads to the
main body of the overture. This begins <i>allegro energico</i>, D major, 2-2,
<span class="pb" id="Page_366">366</span>
in the full orchestra on the first theme, that of the chorus, &ldquo;<i>Gegr&uuml;sst
sei hoher Tag!</i>&rdquo; at the beginning of the first <i>finale</i> of the opera. The
first subsidiary theme enters in the brass, and it is the theme of the
battle hymn (&ldquo;Santo spirito cavaliere&rdquo;) of the revolutionary faction
in the third act. A transitional passage in the violoncellos leads to the
entrance of the second theme&mdash;Rienzi&rsquo;s prayer, already heard in the
introduction of the overture&mdash;which is now given, <i>allegro</i>, in A major,
to the violins. The &ldquo;Santo spirito cavaliere&rdquo; theme returns in the brass,
and leads to another and joyful theme, that of the <i>stretto</i> of the second
<i>finale</i>, &ldquo;Rienzi, dir sei Preis,&rdquo; which is developed with increasing force.
In the <i>coda, molto pi&ugrave; stretto</i>, the &ldquo;Santo spirito cavaliere&rdquo; is developed
in a most robust manner.</p>
<h2 id="c159"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO &ldquo;DER FLIEGENDE HOLL&Auml;NDER&rdquo; (&ldquo;THE FLYING DUTCHMAN&rdquo;)</span></h2>
<p>The overture to <i>The Flying Dutchman</i> gives the condensed and
essential drama. We are relieved of the avaricious father who is
delighted at the thought of handing his daughter to the mysterious
stranger; nor does one have to hear the bleatings of the saphead
lover. No wonder Senta preferred the Dutchman.</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s overture is a stormy seascape. The Dutchman knew no
calm seas. The music that typifies him is one of Wagner&rsquo;s happiest
inventions. Poor Vanderdecken sings nothing so compelling, not
even in his monologue. One hears enough of Senta&rsquo;s ballad in the
overture; one is not tempted to laugh at the operatic spinning
wheels that stick when they should revolve; one does not find Wagner
trying to write with Italian melodiousness.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The overture was sketched at Meudon near Paris in September, 1841,
and completed and scored at Paris in November of that year. In 1852,
Wagner changed the ending. In 1860 he wrote another ending for the
Paris concerts.</p>
<p>It opens <i>allegro con brio</i> in D minor, 6-4, with an empty fifth,
against which horns and bassoons give out the &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_367">367</span>
motive. There is a stormy development, through which this motive
is kept sounding in the brass. There is a hint at the first theme of
the main body of the overture, an <i>arpeggio</i> figure in the strings, taken
from the accompaniment of one of the movements in the Dutchman&rsquo;s
first air in Act I. The storm section over, there is an episodic <i>andante</i>
in F major in which wind instruments give out phrases from Senta&rsquo;s
ballad of the Flying Dutchman (Act II). The episode leads directly
to the main body of the overture, <i>allegro con brio</i> in D minor, 6-4,
which begins with the first theme. This theme is developed at great
length with chromatic passages taken from Senta&rsquo;s ballad. The &ldquo;Flying
Dutchman&rdquo; theme comes in episodically in the brass from time to
time. The subsidiary theme in F major is taken from the sailors&rsquo; chorus,
&ldquo;Steuermann, lass&rsquo; die Wacht!&rdquo; (Act III). The second theme, the
phrase from Senta&rsquo;s ballad already heard in the <i>andante</i> episode, enters
<i>fortissimo</i> in the full orchestra, F major, and is worked up brilliantly
with fragments of the first theme. The &ldquo;Flying Dutchman&rdquo; motive reappears
<i>fortissimo</i> in the trombones. The <i>coda</i> begins in D major, 2-2.
A few rising <i>arpeggio</i> measures in the violins lead to the second theme,
proclaimed with the full force of the orchestra. The theme is now in
the shape found in the <i>allegro</i> peroration of Senta&rsquo;s ballad. It is worked
up energetically.</p>
<p>The overture is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, four horns, two bassoons, two trumpets, three trombones,
bass tuba, kettledrums, harp, strings.</p>
<h2 id="c160"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO TANNH&Auml;USER</span></h2>
<p><i>Tannh&auml;user und der S&auml;ngerkrieg auf Wartburg</i>, Romantic Opera in
three acts, book and music by Wagner, was produced at the Royal
Opera House in Dresden, under the direction of the composer, on
October 19, 1845.</p>
<p>The overture was written in Dresden, probably in March-April,
1845. The first performance of it as a concert piece was at a concert
at Leipsic for the benefit of the Gewandhaus Orchestra Pension Fund,
February 12, 1846. Mendelssohn conducted it from manuscript.</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s own programme of the overture was published in the <i>Neue
Zeitschrift</i> of January 14, 1853. It was written at the request of orchestral
players who were rehearsing the overture for performance at
Zurich. The translation into English is by William Ashton Ellis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_368">368</div>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, the orchestra leads before us the Pilgrims&rsquo; Chant
alone; it draws near, then swells into a mighty outpour, and passes
finally away.&mdash;Evenfall; last echo of the chant. As night breaks, magic
sights and sounds appear, a rosy mist floats up, exultant shouts assail
our ears, the whirlings of a fearsomely voluptuous dance are seen.
These are the Venusberg&rsquo;s seductive spells, that show themselves at
dead of night to those whose breast is fired by daring of the senses.
Attracted by the tempting show, a shapely human form draws nigh; &rsquo;tis
Tannh&auml;user, Love&rsquo;s minstrel.... Venus, herself, appears to him....
As the Pilgrims&rsquo; Chant draws closer, yet closer, as the day drives
farther back the night, that whir and soughing of the air&mdash;which had
erewhile sounded like the eerie cries of souls condemned&mdash;now rises,
too, to ever gladder waves; so that when the sun ascends at last in
splendor, and the Pilgrims&rsquo; Chant proclaims in ecstasy to all the world,
to all that lives and moves thereon, Salvation won, this wave itself
swells out the tidings of sublimest joy. &rsquo;Tis the carol of the Venusberg
itself, redeemed from curse of impiousness, this cry we hear amid the
hymn of God. So wells and leaps each pulse of Life in chorus of
Redemption; and both dissevered elements, both soul and senses, God
and Nature, unite in the atoning kiss of hallowed Love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overture is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass
tuba, kettledrums, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and strings.</p>
<h2 id="c161"><span class="h2line1">PRELUDE TO &ldquo;LOHENGRIN&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>We remember how at one of Theodore Thomas&rsquo;s concerts at
Central Park Garden in New York&mdash;it was in the &rsquo;seventies&mdash;when
this prelude was played we heard strong hissing from many
who would not have &ldquo;the music of the future.&rdquo; And so today there
are &ldquo;lovers of music&rdquo; who cannot endure the music of the present
and swear it cannot be the music of future, for they have ears but
they do not and will not hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Lohengrin</i>, an opera in three acts, was performed for the first time at
the Court Theater, Weimar, August 28, 1850. Liszt conducted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_369">369</div>
<p>Liszt described the prelude as &ldquo;a sort of magic formula which, like
a mysterious initiation, prepares our souls for the sight of unaccustomed
things, and of a higher signification than that of our terrestrial life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s own explanation has been translated into English as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love seemed to have vanished from a world of hatred and quarreling;
as a lawgiver she was no longer to be found among the communities
of men. Emancipating itself from barren care for gain and
possession, the sole arbiter of all worldly intercourse, the human heart&rsquo;s
unquenchable love-longing again at length craved to appease a want,
which, the more warmly and intensely it made itself felt under the
pressure of reality, was the less easy to satisfy, on account of this very
reality. It was beyond the confines of the actual world that man&rsquo;s
ecstatic imaginative power fixed the source as well as the outflow of
this incomprehensible impulse of love, and from the desire of a comforting
sensuous conception of this supersensuous idea invested it with
a wonderful form, which, under the name of the &lsquo;Holy Grail,&rsquo; though
conceived as actually existing, yet unapproachably far off, was believed
in, longed for, and sought for. The Holy Grail was the costly vessel
out of which, at the Last Supper, our Saviour drank with His disciples,
and in which His blood was received when out of love for His
brethren He suffered upon a cross, and which till this day has been
preserved with lively zeal as the source of undying love; albeit, at one
time this cup of salvation was taken away from unworthy mankind,
but at length was brought back again from the heights of heaven by a
band of angels, and delivered into the keeping of fervently loving,
solitary men, who, wondrously strengthened and blessed by its presence,
and purified in heart, were consecrated as the earthly champions of
eternal love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This miraculous delivery of the Holy Grail, escorted by an angelic
host, and the handing of it over into the custody of highly favored men,
was selected by the author of <i>Lohengrin</i>, a knight of the Grail, for the
introduction of his drama, as the subject to be musically portrayed;
just as here, for the sake of explanation, he may be allowed to bring
it forward as an object for the mental receptive power of his hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prelude is scored for three flutes, two oboes, English horn, two
clarinets, bass clarinet, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones,
bass tuba, kettledrums, cymbals, and strings.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c162"><span class="h2line1">PRELUDE AND LIEBESTOD FROM &ldquo;TRISTAN UND ISOLDE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The subject of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> was first mentioned by Wagner
in a letter to Liszt in the latter part of 1854; the poem was written at
Z&uuml;rich in the summer of 1857, and finished in September of that year.
The composition of the first act was completed at Z&uuml;rich, December 31,
1857 (some say, but only in the sketch); the second act was completed
at Venice in March, 1859; the third act at Lucerne in August, 1859.</p>
<p>Wagner himself frequently conducted the prelude and Love-Death,
arranged by him for orchestra alone, in the concerts given by him in
1863. At those given in Carlsruhe and L&ouml;wenberg the programme
characterized the prelude as <i>Liebestod</i> and the latter section, now
known as <i>Liebestod</i>, as <i>Verkl&auml;rung</i> (Transfiguration).</p>
<p>The prelude, <i>langsam und schmachtend</i> (slow and languishingly),
in A minor, 6-8, is a gradual and long-continued <i>crescendo</i> to a most
sonorous <i>fortissimo</i>; a shorter <i>decrescendo</i> leads back to <i>pianissimo</i>.
It is free in form and of continuous development. There are two chief
themes: the first phrase, sung by violoncellos, is combined in the third
measure with a phrase ascending chromatically and given to the oboes.</p>
<p>These phrases form a theme known as the &ldquo;Love Potion&rdquo; motive,
or the motive of &ldquo;Longing&rdquo;; for passionate commentators are not yet
agreed about the terminology. The second theme, again sung by the
violoncellos, a voluptuous theme, is entitled &ldquo;Tristan&rsquo;s Love Glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prelude is scored for three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, four horns, three
trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, harp, and the usual
strings.</p>
<p>Wagner wrote this explanatory programme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A primitive old love poem, which, far from having become extinct,
is constantly fashioning itself anew, and has been adopted by every
European language of the Middle Ages, tells us of Tristan and Isolde.
Tristan, the faithful vassal, woos for his king her for whom he dares
not avow his own love, Isolde. Isolde, powerless to do otherwise than
obey the wooer, follows him as bride to his lord. Jealous of this infringement
of her rights, the Goddess of Love takes her revenge. As the
result of a happy mistake, she allows the couple to taste of the love
potion which, in accordance with the custom of the times, and by way
<span class="pb" id="Page_371">371</span>
of precaution, the mother had prepared for the husband who should
marry her daughter from political motives, and which, by the burning
desire which suddenly inflames them after tasting it, opens their eyes
to the truth and leads to the avowal that for the future they belong only
to each other. Henceforth, there is no end to the longings, the demands,
the joys and woes of love. The world, power, fame, splendor,
honor, knighthood, fidelity, friendship, all are dissipated like an empty
dream. One thing only remains: longing, longing, insatiable longing, forever
springing up anew, pining and thirsting. Death, which means
passing away, perishing, never awakening, their only deliverance....
Powerless, the heart sinks back to languish in longing, in longing
without attaining; for each attainment only begets new longing, until
in the last stage of weariness the foreboding of the highest joy of dying,
of no longer existing, of the last escape into that wonderful kingdom
from which we are furthest off when we are most strenuously
striving to enter therein. Shall we call it death? Or is it the hidden
wonder-world from out of which an ivy and vine, entwined with each
other, grew up upon Tristan&rsquo;s and Isolde&rsquo;s grave, as the legend tells
us?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c163"><span class="h2line1">PRELUDE TO &ldquo;DIE MEISTERSINGER VON N&Uuml;RNBERG&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The idea of the opera occurred to Wagner at Marienbad in 1845.
He then sketched a scenario which differed widely from the one finally
adopted. It is possible that certain scenes were written while he was at
work on <i>Lohengrin</i>; there is a legend that the quintet was finished in
1845. Some add to this quintet the songs of Sachs and Walther. Wagner
wrote to a friend on March 12, 1862: &ldquo;Tomorrow I hope at least to
begin the composition of <i>Die Meistersinger</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the libretto was completed
at Paris in 1861. He worked at Biebrich on the Rhine in 1862
on the music. The prelude was sketched in February of that year. The
instrumentation was completed in the following June.</p>
<p>He wrote to his friend Dr. Anton Pusinelli from Penzing near
Vienna on March 14, 1864: &ldquo;I have tried with the greatest care to
ensure myself the proper leisure for completing the <i>Meistersinger</i> by
next winter. Unfortunately, everything has been very difficult for me
because my continual indisposition and my sad frame of mind have
kept company with my other trials, so as to make it more difficult
<span class="pb" id="Page_372">372</span>
for me to have any desire for work.&rdquo; He wrote again to Pusinelli in a
long letter about his &ldquo;poor wife&rdquo; Minna, questioning whether he should
return to her: &ldquo;Under favorable conditions I finally <i>can</i> complete my
<i>Meistersinger</i>. Very probably this work will quickly become popular,
and it <i>can</i> bring in good returns for me. But one can&rsquo;t <i>count</i> on this,
and my life from month to month must not depend on such possibilities;
for if I have no &lsquo;good inspirations,&rsquo; then I have nothing to write
down, and with continual worries I no longer have very good inspirations
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Lucerne on May 10, 1866, he wrote that he had won for a little
time the quiet for creating &ldquo;a great and joyful work. Wish me this
success and&mdash;perhaps I dare to say it&mdash;wish it to the world!&rdquo; He had
already completed Act I and was progressing well with Act II, which
was finished in December.</p>
<p>In 1868 he wrote from Lucerne: &ldquo;In Dresden I had in mind an
attempt to procure some guarantee for the <i>Meistersinger</i> against
abominable incompetence of the <i>Kapellmeisters</i> there, and with what
a nice reception was I met there!&rdquo; The principal <i>Kapellmeister</i> was
Julius Rietz, who was hostile to Wagner, as he had been at Leipsic.</p>
<p>The prelude is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets,
two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba,
kettledrums, triangle, cymbals, harp, and the usual strings.</p>
<p>Wagner in his Autobiography tells how the idea of <i>Die Meistersinger</i>
formed itself; how he began to elaborate it in the hope that it might
free him from the thrall of the idea of <i>Lohengrin</i>; but he was impelled
to go back to the latter opera. The melody for the fragment of Sachs&rsquo;
poem on the Reformation occurred to him while going through the
galleries of the Palais Royal on his way to the Taverne Anglaise.
&ldquo;There I found Truinet already waiting for me and asked him to give
me a scrap of paper and a pencil to jot down my melody, which I
quietly hummed over to him at the time.&rdquo; &ldquo;As from the balcony of my
flat, in a sunset of great splendor, I gazed upon the magnificent
spectacle of &lsquo;Golden&rsquo; Mayence, with the majestic Rhine pouring along
its outskirts in a glory of light, the prelude to my <i>Meistersinger</i> again
suddenly made its presence closely and distinctly felt in my soul. Once
before had I seen it rise before me out of a lake of sorrow, like some
distant mirage. I proceeded to write down the prelude exactly as it
appears today in the score, that is, containing the clear outlines of the
leading themes of the whole drama.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">373</div>
<p>Wagner conducted the two overtures. The hall was nearly empty;
there was a pecuniary loss. This was a sore disappointment to Wagner,
who had written to Weissheimer on October 12, 1862: &ldquo;Good: <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>
overture, then. That&rsquo;s all right for me. For what I now have
in mind is to make an out-and-out sensation, so as to make money.&rdquo;
He had proposed to add the prelude and <i>finale</i> of <i>Tristan</i> to the Prelude
to &ldquo;<i>Die Meistersinger</i>&rdquo;; but his friends in Leipsic advised the substitution
of the overture to <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>. There was not the faintest
applause when Wagner came on the platform; but the prelude to <i>Die
Meistersinger</i> was received with such favor that it was immediately
played a second time.</p>
<p>One critic wrote of the <i>Meistersinger</i> prelude, &ldquo;The overture, a long
movement in moderate march tempo, with predominating brass, without
any chief thoughts and without noticeable and recurring points
of rest, went along and soon awakened a feeling of monotony.&rdquo; The
critic of the <i>Mitteldeutsche Volkzeitung</i> wrote in terms of enthusiasm.
The <i>Signal&rsquo;s</i> critic was bitter in opposition. He wrote at length and
finally characterized the prelude as &ldquo;chaos,&rdquo; a &ldquo;tohu-wabohu and nothing
more.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c164"><span class="h2line1">A SIEGFRIED IDYL</span></h2>
<p>Cosima Liszt, daughter of Franz Liszt and the Countess d&rsquo;Agoult,
was born at Bellagio, Italy, on Christmas Day, 1837. She was married
to Hans von B&uuml;low at Berlin, August 18, 1857. They were divorced in
the fall of 1869.</p>
<p>Richard Wagner married Minna Planer on November 24, 1836, at
K&ouml;nigsberg. They separated in August, 1861. She died at Dresden,
January 25, 1866.</p>
<p>Wagner and Cosima were married at Lucerne, August 25, 1870.
Their son, Siegfried Wagner, was born at Triebschen, near Lucerne,
on June 6, 1869.</p>
<p>In a letter to Frau Wille, June 25, 1870, Wagner wrote of Cosima:
&ldquo;She has defied every disapprobation and taken upon herself every
condemnation. She has borne to me a wonderfully beautiful boy, whom
I can boldly call &lsquo;Siegfried&rsquo;; he is now growing, together with my work;
he gives me a new long life, which at last has attained a meaning.
Thus we get along without the world, from which we have wholly
withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>The <i>Siegfried Idyl</i> was a birthday gift to Cosima. It was composed
in November, 1870, at Triebschen. Hans Richter received the manuscript
score on December 4, 1870. Wagner gave a fine copy of it to
Cosima. Musicians of Z&uuml;rich were engaged for the performance. The
first rehearsal was on December 21, 1870, in the foyer of Z&uuml;rich&rsquo;s
old theater. The Wesendocks were present. Wagner conducted a rehearsal
at the H&ocirc;tel du Lac, Lucerne, on December 24. Christmas fell
on a Sunday. Early in the morning the musicians assembled at Wagner&rsquo;s
villa in Triebschen. In order to surprise Cosima, the desks were put
on the stairs and the tuning was in the kitchen. The orchestra took
its place on the stairs, Wagner, who conducted, at the top; then
the violins, violas, wood-wind instruments, horns, and at the bottom
the violoncello and the double bass. Wagner could not see the
violoncello and the double bass; but the performance, according to
Richter, was faultless. The orchestra was thus composed: two first
violins, two second violins, two violas (one played by Richter, who
also played the few measures for a trumpet), one violoncello, one
double bass, one flute, one oboe, two clarinets, one bassoon, two
horns. Richter, in order not to excite Cosima&rsquo;s suspicions, practised
for some days the trumpet part in the empty barracks. &ldquo;These daily
excursions and several trips to Z&uuml;rich awakened the attention of
Mme Wagner, who thought I was not so industrious as formerly.&rdquo;
The performance began at 7.30 <span class="small">A. M.</span> The <i>Idyl</i> was repeated several
times in the course of the day, and in the afternoon Beethoven&rsquo;s
Sextet was performed without the variations.</p>
<p>The <i>Idyl</i> was performed at Mannheim on December 20, 1871, in
private and under Wagner&rsquo;s direction. There was a performance on
March 10, 1877, in the Ducal Palace at Meiningen. Wagner conducted.
The score and parts were published in February, 1878. The
first performance after publication was at a Bilse concert in Berlin
toward the end of February, 1878. The music drama <i>Siegfried</i> was
then so little known that a Berlin critic said the <i>Idyl</i> was taken
from the second act. And Mr. Henry Knight, a passionate Wagnerite,
wrote verses in 1889 in which he showed a similar confusion
in mental operation.</p>
<p>This composition first bore the title <i>Triebschener Idyll</i>. The score
calls for flute, oboe, two clarinets, bassoon, trumpet, two horns, and
strings.</p>
<p>Siegfried was born while Wagner was at work on his music
<span class="pb" id="Page_375">375</span>
drama <i>Siegfried</i>. The themes in the <i>Idyl</i> were taken from this music
drama, all save one: a folk-song, &ldquo;Schlaf&rsquo;, mein Kind, schlaf&rsquo;ein&rdquo;;
but the development of the themes was new.</p>
<h2 id="c165"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;THE RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES,&rdquo; FROM &ldquo;DIE WALK&Uuml;RE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>After an instrumental introduction to Act III of <i>The Valkyrie</i>,
the curtain rises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the summit of a rocky mountain. On the right a pine wood
encloses the stage. On the left is the entrance to a cave; above this
the rock rises to its highest point. At the back the view is entirely
open; rocks of various heights form a parapet to the precipice.
Occasionally clouds fly past the mountain peak as if driven by storm.
Gerhilde, Ortlinde, Waltraute, and Schwertleite have ensconced
themselves on the rocky peak above the cave; they are in full
armor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flashes of lightning break through the clouds, and from time to
time a Valkyrie is seen on horseback with a slain warrior hanging
from the saddle. We quote John F. Runciman&rsquo;s description of the
Valkyries&rsquo; Ride:<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The drama here is of the most poignant kind; the scenic surroundings
are of the sort Wagner so greatly loved&mdash;tempest amidst
black pine woods with wild, flying clouds, the dying down of the
storm, the saffron evening light melting into shadowy night, the
calm, deep blue sky with the stars peeping out, then the bright
flames shooting up; and the two elements, the dramatic and the
pictorial, drew out of him some pages as splendid as any even he
ever wrote. The opening, &lsquo;The Ride of the Valkyries,&rsquo; is a piece of
storm music without a parallel. There is no need here for Donner
with his hammer; the All-Father himself is abroad in wrath and
majesty, and his daughters laugh and rejoice in the riot. There is
nothing uncanny in the music: we have that delight in the sheer
force of the elements which we inherit from our earliest ancestors:
the joy of nature fiercely at work which is echoed in our hearts from
time immemorial. The shrilling of the wind, the hubbub, the calls
of the Valkyries to one another, the galloping of the horses, form a
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">376</span>
picture which for splendor, wild energy, and wilder beauty can
never be matched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technically, this Ride is a miracle built up of conventional
figurations of the older music. There is the continuous shake, handed
on from instrument to instrument, the slashing figure of the upper
strings, the kind of <i>basso ostinato</i>, conventionally indicating the galloping
of horses, and the chief melody, a mere bugle call, altered by
a change of rhythm into a thing of superb strength. The only part of
the music that ever so remotely suggests extravagance is the Valkyries&rsquo;
call; and it, after all, is only a jodel put to sublime uses. Out
of these commonplace elements, elements that one might almost
call prosaic, Wagner wrought his picture of storm, with its terror,
power, joyous laughter of the storm&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;storm as it must
have seemed to the first poets of our race....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worth looking at the plan of this Ride&mdash;which is, be it remembered,
only the prelude to the gigantic drama which is to follow.
After the <i>ritornello</i> the main theme is announced, with a long break
between the first and second strains; and again a break before it is
continued. Then it sounds out all its glory, terse, closely gripped
section to section, until the Valkyries&rsquo; call is heard; purely pictorial
passages follow; the theme is played with, even as Mozart and
Beethoven played with their themes, and at the last the whole force
of the orchestra is employed, and Wagner&rsquo;s object is attained&mdash;he has
given us a picture of storm such as was never done before, and he
has done what was necessary for the subsequent drama&mdash;made us
feel the tremendous might of the god of storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arrangement for concert use calls for these instruments: two
piccolos, two flutes, three oboes, English horn, three clarinets, bass
clarinet, three bassoons, eight horns, three trumpets, four trombones,
bass tuba, kettledrums, side drum, cymbals, triangle, and the usual
strings.</p>
<h2 id="c166"><span class="h2line1">PRELUDE TO &ldquo;PARSIFAL&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Wagner, with his theatrical sense, was right: this music is not so
impressive when it is performed, no matter how well, outside of
the Bayreuth theater consecrated to the music dramas. We heard
<i>Parsifal</i> the year it was produced at Bayreuth. No performance of
the prelude has since awakened the same emotions. There was the
<span class="pb" id="Page_377">377</span>
silence of deep devotion; the presence of the worshipers, fanatics in
the great majority; the expectation of marvelous scenes to come as
the wailing first phrase rose from the unseen orchestra. Put this
prelude in the conventional opera house, or in the concert hall,
and it cannot be ranked with Wagner&rsquo;s greatest works.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>The prelude to <i>Parsifal</i> was composed at Bayreuth in September,
1877. The first performance was a private one in the hall of the Villa
Wahnfried at Bayreuth, on December 25, 1878, to celebrate the birthday
of Cosima Wagner. The prelude was performed as a morning
serenade by the Meiningen Court Orchestra, led by Wagner. The performance
was repeated the evening of the same day, when guests were
invited.</p>
<p>The score and orchestral parts were published in October, 1882.
<i>Parsifal</i>, &ldquo;a stage-consecration-festival play&rdquo; in three acts, book and
music by Richard Wagner, was first performed at Bayreuth for the
patrons, July 26, 1882. The first public performance was on July 30,
1882. Hermann Levi conducted.</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s version of the story of Percival, or, as he prefers, Parsifal,
is familiar to all. There is no need in a description of the prelude to
this music drama of telling the simple tale or pondering its symbolism.
The ethical idea of the drama is that enlightenment coming through
conscious pity brings salvation. The clearest and the sanest exposition
of the prelude is that included by Maurice Kufferath in his elaborate
essay, <i>Parsifal</i> (Paris: Fischbacher, 1890). We give portions of this
exposition in a greatly condensed form:</p>
<p>Without preparation the prelude opens with a broad melodic phrase,
which is sung later in the great religious scene of the first act, during
the mystic feast, the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p>The phrase is sung, at first without accompaniment, in unison by
violins, violoncello, English horn, clarinet, bassoon, <i>sehr langsam</i> (<i>lento
assai</i>), A flat major, 4-4. This motive is repeated by trumpet, oboes,
and half the first and second violins in unison against rising and falling
<i>arpeggios</i> in the violas and remaining violins, repeated chords for flutes,
clarinets, and English horn, and sustained harmonies in bassoons and
horns. This theme is known as the motive of the &ldquo;Last Supper.&rdquo; The
second phrase of the motive is given out and repeated as before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">378</div>
<p>Without any other transition than a series of broken chords, the
trombones and the trumpets give out the second theme, the &ldquo;Grail&rdquo;
motive, because it serves throughout the music drama to characterize
the worship of the holy relic. It is a very short theme, which afterwards
will enter constantly, sometimes alone, sometimes in company
with other themes, often modified in rhythm, but preserving always its
characteristic harmonies. As William J. Henderson says: &ldquo;The second
theme of the prelude is that of the Grail itself, which is here presented
to us in a different musical aspect from that of the <i>Lohengrin</i> score.
There the Grail was celebrated as a potency by which the world was
aided, while here it is brought before us as the visible embodiment of a
faith, the memento of a crucified Saviour.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> This theme is not original
with Wagner. The ascending progression of sixths, which forms the
conclusion of the theme, is found in the Saxon liturgy and is in use
today in the &ldquo;Court&rdquo; Church at Dresden. Mendelssohn employed it in
the <i>Reformation</i> symphony; therefore, zealous admirers of Mendelssohn
have accused Wagner of plagiarism. The two masters, who knew
Dresden well, probably were struck by the harmonic structure of this
conclusion, and they used it, each in his own way. Anyone has a personal
right to this simple formula. The true inventor of the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; is
unknown; the formula has been attributed to Silvani. Its harmonic
nature would indicate that it belongs to the seventeenth century, but
there are analogous progressions in Palestrina&rsquo;s Masses. The &ldquo;Grail&rdquo;
motive is repeated twice.</p>
<p>Then, and again without transition, but with a change of tempo to
6-4, comes the third motive, that of &ldquo;Belief.&rdquo; The brass first proclaims
it.</p>
<p>The strings take up the &ldquo;Grail&rdquo; theme. The &ldquo;Belief&rdquo; motive reappears
four times in succession, in different tonalities.</p>
<p>A roll of drums on A flat is accompanied by a tremolo of double
basses, giving the contra F. The first motive, the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper,&rdquo;
enters first (wood-wind, afterwards in the violoncellos). This time the
motive is not completed. Wagner stops at the third measure and takes
a new subject, which is repeated several times with increasing expression
of sorrow. There is, then, a fourth theme derived from the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Supper&rdquo; motive. The first two measures, which are found in simpler
form and without the appoggiatura in the &ldquo;Supper&rdquo; theme, will serve
hereafter to characterize more particularly the &ldquo;Holy Lance&rdquo; that
<span class="pb" id="Page_379">379</span>
pierced the side of Christ and also caused the wound of Amfortas, the
lance that drew the sacred blood which was turned into the communion
wine; the lance that fell into the hands of Klingsor, the Magician.</p>
<p>At the moment when this fourth theme, which suggests the sufferings
of Christ and Amfortas, bursts forth from the whole orchestra,
the Prelude has its climax. This prelude, like unto that of <i>Lohengrin</i>,
is developed by successive degrees until it reaches a maximum of expression,
and there is a <i>diminuendo</i> to <i>pianissimo</i>.</p>
<p>Thus the synthesis of the whole drama has been clearly exposed. That
which remains is only a peroration, a logical, necessary conclusion,
brought about by the ideas expressed by the different themes. It is by
the sight of suffering that Parsifal learns pity and saves Amfortas. It is
the motive of the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo; that signifies both devotion and
sacrifice; that is to say Love, and Love is the conclusion. The last
chords of the expiring lament lead back gently to the first two measures
of the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo; motive, which, repeated from octave to octave
on a pedal (E flat), end in a series of ascending chords, a prayer, or a
supplication. Is there hope? The drama gives the answer to this question
full of anguish.</p>
<p>The prelude is scored for three flutes, three oboes, English horn,
three clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, double bassoon, four horns,
three trumpets, three trombones, bass tuba, kettledrums, and strings.</p>
<h2 id="c167"><span class="h2line1">&ldquo;GOOD FRIDAY SPELL,&rdquo; FROM &ldquo;PARSIFAL&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>When Parsifal turns slowly towards the meadow, a hymn of tender
thanksgiving arises from the orchestra. The melody is played by flute
and oboe, which muted strings sustain. In the development of this
theme occur several figures&mdash;&ldquo;Kundry&rsquo;s Sigh,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Holy Supper,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Spear,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Grail&rdquo; harmonies, the &ldquo;Complaint of the Flower Girls,&rdquo;
which are all finally absorbed in the &ldquo;Good Friday&rdquo; melody. This
pastoral is suddenly interrupted by the sound of distant bells, sounding
mournfully from afar.</p>
<p>Gurnemanz and Kundry robe Parsifal. They set out for Montsalvat.</p>
<p>When Gurnemanz blesses Parsifal and salutes him king, horns,
trumpets, and trombones play the &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo; motive, which is developed
imposingly and ends with the &ldquo;Grail&rdquo; theme, intoned by the
whole orchestra <i>fortissimo</i>. A series of chords leads to the motives of
&ldquo;Baptism&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faith.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c168"><span class="h2line1">CARL MARIA</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">VON WEBER</span></h2>
<p class="center">(Born at Eutin, Oldenburg, December 18, 1786; died at London, June 5, 1826)</p>
<p>Mr. William Apthorp frequently spoke of the &ldquo;Weberian flourish,&rdquo;
of the chivalric spirit shown, not only in Weber&rsquo;s overtures to
<i>Euryanthe</i> and <i>Oberon</i>, but in much of his music for the piano.
Weber&rsquo;s operas are wholly unknown as stage works to the younger
generation. <i>Oberon</i> is a dull opera, with some beautiful music.
<i>Euryanthe</i>, too, is dull, dull beyond redemption, although at Dresden
years ago we saw a most carefully prepared performance, for
the cult of Weber in that city was then firmly established, and nowhere
else was Der Freisch&uuml;tz so admirably performed. Yet Weber
was a mighty man in his day, influencing composers of other countries
than his own, praised to the skies by Berlioz and Wagner.
The latter had good reason for his enthusiasm; the influence of
<i>Euryanthe</i> is observed in his early operas. Weber was a romanticist
of the E. T. A. Hoffmann order. The music for the scene of
the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen in <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i> is in no need of fireworks and
ghostly apparitions for its terrifying effects. There is charming fairy
music in <i>Oberon</i>. Then there is the mysterious <i>largo</i> in the <i>Euryanthe</i>
overture. The grand arias, the set pieces for a soprano, with
the final <i>allegro</i> section better suited to an orchestral instrument
than the human voice, are now singularly out of fashion, but what
could be better as music for a particular text than that for the opening
scenes of <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i>? The three overtures will long preserve
the composer&rsquo;s name.</p>

<h2 id="c169"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO THE OPERA &ldquo;OBERON&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><i>Oberon; or, the Elf-King&rsquo;s Oath</i>, a romantic opera in three acts, book
by James Robinson Planch&eacute;, who founded it on Villeneuve&rsquo;s story
&ldquo;Huon de Bordeaux&rdquo; and Sotheby&rsquo;s English translation of Wieland&rsquo;s
German poem, &ldquo;Oberon,&rdquo; was first performed at Covent Garden,
London, on April 12, 1826. Weber conducted. The first performance
in New York was at the Park Theatre on October 9, 1828.</p>
<p>Weber was asked by Charles Kemble in 1824 to write an opera for
the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. Weber chose &ldquo;Oberon&rdquo; for the
subject. Planch&eacute; was selected to furnish the libretto. In a letter to him,
Weber wrote that the fashion of it was foreign to his ideas: &ldquo;The
intermixing of so many principal actors who do not sing&mdash;the omission
of the music in the most important moments&mdash;all these things deprive
our <i>Oberon</i> of the title of an opera, and will make him [<i>sic</i>] unfit for
all other theaters in Europe, which is a very bad thing for me, but&mdash;<i>passons
l&agrave;-dessous</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weber, a sick and discouraged man, buckled himself to the task of
learning English, that he might know the exact meaning of the text.
He therefore took one hundred and fifty-three lessons of an Englishman
named Carey and studied diligently, anxiously. Planch&eacute; sent the
libretto to Dresden an act at a time. Weber made his first sketch on
January 23, 1825. The autograph score contains this note at the end
of the overture: &ldquo;Finished April 9, 1826, in the morning, at a quarter
of twelve, and with it the whole opera. <i>Soli Deo Gloria!!!</i> C. M. V.
Weber.&rdquo; This entry was made at London. Weber received for the
opera &pound;500. He was so feeble that he could scarcely stand without
support, but he rehearsed and directed the performance seated at the
piano. He died of consumption about two months after the production.</p>
<p>Planch&eacute; gives a lively account of the genesis and production of
<i>Oberon</i>. He describes the London public as unmusical. &ldquo;A dramatic
situation in music was &lsquo;caviare to the general,&rsquo; and inevitably received
with cries of &lsquo;Cut it short!&rsquo; from the gallery, and obstinate coughing or
other significant signs of impatience from the pit. Nothing but the
&lsquo;Huntsmen&rsquo;s Chorus&rsquo; and the <i>diablerie</i> in <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i> saved that
fine work from immediate condemnation in England; and I remember
perfectly well the exquisite melodies in it being compared by English
musical critics to &lsquo;wind through a keyhole.&rsquo; ... None of our actors
<span class="pb" id="Page_382">382</span>
could sing, and but one singer could act, Madame Vestris, who made
a charming Fatima.... My great object was to land Weber safe
amidst an unmusical public, and I therefore wrote a melodrama with
songs, instead of an opera such as would be required at the present
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first performance in Germany of <i>Oberon</i> was at Leipsic, December
23, 1826.</p>
<p>The overture begins with an introduction (<i>adagio sostenuto ed il
tutto pianissimo possibile</i>, D major, 4-4). The horn of Oberon is answered
by muted strings. The figure for flutes and clarinets is taken
from the first scene of the opera (Oberon&rsquo;s palace; introduction and
chorus of elfs). After a <i>pianissimo</i> little march, there is a short dreamy
passage for strings, which ends in the violas. There is a full orchestral
crashing chord, and the main body of the overture begins (<i>allegro con
fuoco</i> in D major, 4-4). The brilliant opening measures are taken
from the accompaniment figure of the quartet, &ldquo;Over the Dark Blue
Waters,&rdquo; sung by Rezia, Fatima, Huon, Scherasmin (Act II, Scene x).
The horn of Oberon is heard again; it is answered by the skipping
fairy figure. The second theme (A major, sung first by the clarinet,
then by the first violins) is taken from the first measures of the second
part of Huon&rsquo;s air (Act I, No. 5). And then a theme is taken from the
peroration, <i>presto con fuoco</i>, of Rezia&rsquo;s air &ldquo;Ocean! Thou mighty
monster&rdquo; (Act II, No. 13), and given as a conclusion to the violins.
This theme ends the first part of the overture. The free fantasia begins
with soft repeated chords in bassoons, horns, drums, basses. The first
theme is worked out in short periods; a new theme is introduced and
treated in <i>fugato</i> against a running contrapuntal counter theme in the
strings. The second theme is treated, but not elaborately; and then the
Rezia motive brings the spirited end.</p>
<h2 id="c170"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO THE OPERA &ldquo;DER FREISCH&Uuml;TZ&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>What would conductors do without these three overtures of
Weber? They are to them in time of perplexity what <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i> and <i>Pagliacci</i> are to opera managers. And yet, in spite of
countless performances, the overture to <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i> is not stale.
The part song for the horns still charms the ear, although it is now
associated with &ldquo;when the sun glorious&rdquo; and other sacred words
<span class="pb" id="Page_383">383</span>
for service in the meeting house. The Samiel motive is still dramatically
sinister and brings back memories of the red-cloaked
fiend as we have seen him on the German stage. And the clarinet
theme, typical of Max, is still worthy of the famous praise of Berlioz.
When there is talk of this overture there is frequently a
reference to an article about it written by Douglas Jerrold. Was
this article ever republished in an edition of Jerrold&rsquo;s works? Has
anyone now living ever read it?</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i>, a romantic opera in three acts, book by Friedrich
Kind, music by Weber, was performed at Berlin, June 18, 1821. Weber
wrote in his diary that the opera was received with &ldquo;incredible enthusiasm;
Overture and Folksong were encored; fourteen out of seventeen
music pieces were stormily applauded. Everything went exceedingly
well, and was sung <i>con amore</i>. I was called before the curtain and
took Mad. [<i>sic</i>] Seidler and Mlle. [<i>sic</i>] Eunike with me as I could not
get hold of the others. Verses and wreaths came flying. &lsquo;<i>Soli Deo
Gloria</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; Some of these verses were malicious, and reflected on
Spontini, much to Weber&rsquo;s distress.</p>
<p>Weber began work on the overture on February 22, 1820. On May 13
he noted in his diary: &ldquo;Overture of <i>Die J&auml;gersbraut</i> finished, and with
it the whole opera. God be praised, and to Him alone be the glory&rdquo;
(<i>Die J&auml;gersbraut</i> was the original title of the opera; it was kept until into
the year 1820, when Weber changed it to <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i> at the advice
of Count Bruhl, Intendant of the Berlin Court theaters). Weber heard
the music for the first time at a rehearsal of the Dresden Orchestra,
June 10, 1820. This was the first music of the opera that he heard.</p>
<p>We have mentioned the success of this overture at Berlin, when it
was played as the prelude to the opera and under Weber&rsquo;s direction; a
success that dumfounded the followers of Spontini and settled the
future of German opera in the capital. And so, wherever the overture
was played, the effect was overwhelming&mdash;as in London, where the
opera was first performed in English, July 22 (?), 1824, at the English
opera house. W. T. Parke wrote: &ldquo;The music of this opera is such a
continued display of science, taste, and melody as to justify any praises
bestowed on it. The overture embraces most of the subjects of the airs
<span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
in the opera, ingeniously interwoven with each other, and is quite
original. The grandeur of some passages and the finely contrasted
simplicity of others produced an effect which was irresistible. It was
vehemently encored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much has been written about the overture, from the rhapsody of
Douglas Jerrold to Wagner&rsquo;s critical remarks concerning the true reading.
The enthusiasm of Berlioz is well known: &ldquo;The overture is
crowned Queen; today no one dreams of disputing it. It is cited as the
model of the kind. The theme of the slow movement and that of the
<i>allegro</i> are sung everywhere. There is one theme that I must mention,
because it is less noticed, and also because it moves me incomparably
more than all the rest. It is that long, groaning melody, thrown by
the clarinet over the tremolo of the orchestra, like unto a far-off
lamentation scattered by the winds in the depths of the forest. It
strikes home to the heart; and for me, at least, this virginal song, which
seems to breathe skyward a timid reproach, while a somber harmony
shudders and threatens, is one of the most novel, poetic, and beautiful
contrasts that modern art has produced in music. In this instrumental
inspiration one can already recognize easily a reflection of the character
of Agathe, which is soon to develop in all its passionate purity.
The theme is borrowed, however, from the part of Max. It is the cry
of the young hunter at the moment when, from his rocky height, he
sounds with his eyes the abysses of the infernal glen. Changed a little
in outline, and orchestrated in this manner, the phrase is different
both in aspect and accent.&rdquo; Compare with this the remarks of Berlioz
in the section on the clarinet in his &ldquo;Treatise on Instrumentation.&rdquo;
The clarinet, he says, has the precious faculty of producing &ldquo;distance,
echo, an echo of echo, and a twilight sound.... What more admirable
example could I quote of the application of some of these shadowings
than the dreamy phrase of the clarinet, accompanied by a tremolo
of stringed instruments in the midst of the <i>allegro</i> of the overture to
<i>Freisch&uuml;tz</i>? Does it not depict the lonely maiden, the forester&rsquo;s fair
betrothed, who, raising her eyes to heaven, mingles her tender lament
with the noise of the dark woods agitated by the storm? O Weber!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overture begins <i>adagio</i>, C major, 4-4. After eight measures of
introduction there is a part song for four horns. This section of the
overture is not connected in any way with subsequent stage action.
After the quarter the Samiel motive appears, and there is the thought
of Max and his temptation. The main body of the overture is <i>molto</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">385</span>
<i>vivace</i>, C minor, 2-2. The sinister music rises to a climax, which is
repeated during the casting of the seventh bullet in the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen.
In the next episode, E flat major, themes associated with Max (clarinet)
and Agathe (first violins and clarinet) appear. The climax of the first
section reappears, now in major, and there is use of Agathe&rsquo;s theme.
There is repetition of the demoniac music that introduces the <i>allegro</i>,
and Samiel&rsquo;s motive dominates the modulation to the <i>coda</i>, C major,
<i>fortissimo</i>, which is the apotheosis of Agathe.</p>
<h2 id="c171"><span class="h2line1">OVERTURE TO THE OPERA &ldquo;EURYANTHE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The overture is not without a certain old-fashioned but veritable
pomp; it has the spirit of ceremony which the admirers of Weber
call &ldquo;the chivalric spirit.&rdquo; It would be perhaps an idle task for an
ultra-modern to insist that the only music in this overture that
appeals to the men and women of the younger generation is that
of the short episode which was originally intended to accompany
a pantomimic scene on the stage, a scene of old-fashioned romantic
melodrama, with tomb, kneeling heroine, gliding ghost, and an
eavesdropping, intriguing woman. In these few mysterious measures
Weber thought far beyond his period. The ultra-modern
might say that the rest of the music is decorative and that the decorations
are substantial till they are cumbrous; that the melodies are
like unto a cameo brooch worn by a woman who remembers
nights of coquetry and dances long out of fashion; that the few
measures of counterpoint show Weber as a plodding amateur.
Nevertheless, the conventionally jubilant swing and the impetuous
pace still make their way in a concert hall.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p><i>Euryanthe</i>, grand heroic-romantic opera in three acts, book founded
by Helmina von Chezy on an old French tale of the thirteenth century,
&ldquo;Histoire de G&eacute;rard de Nevers et de la belle et vertueuse Euryant de
Savoye, sa mie&rdquo;&mdash;a tale used by Boccaccio (<i>Decameron</i>, second day,
ninth novel) and Shakespeare (<i>Cymbeline</i>)&mdash;music by Weber, was
<span class="pb" id="Page_386">386</span>
produced at the K&auml;rnthnerthor Court Opera Theater, Vienna, October
25, 1823. The composer conducted. Domineco Barbaja, manager of the
K&auml;rnthnerthor and the An der Wien theaters, had commissioned
Weber to write for the former opera house an opera in the style of
<i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i>. Weber had several librettos in mind before he chose
that of <i>Euryanthe</i>; he was impressed by one concerning the Cid, by
Friedrich Kind. The two quarreled. Then he thought of the story of
Dido, Queen of Carthage, as told by Ludwig Rellstab, but this subject
had tempted many composers before him. Helmina von Chezy, living
in Dresden when Weber was there, had written the text of &ldquo;Rosamunde&rdquo;
to which Schubert set music. The failure of this work apparently
did not frighten Weber from accepting a libretto from her. She
had translated a version of the old French tale mentioned above for a
collection of medieval poems (<i>Sammlung romantischer Dichtungen
des Mittelalters</i>), edited by Fr. Schlegel, which was published at
Leipsic in 1804. She entitled her version, &ldquo;Die Geschichte der Tugendsamen
Euryanthe von Savoyen&rdquo; (The Story of the Innocent Euryanthe
of Savoy). The original version is in the <i>Roman de la Violette</i>, by
Gilbert de Montreuil.</p>
<p>As soon as the text of the first act was ready (December 15, 1821),
Weber began to compose the music. He wrote a large portion of the
opera at Hosterwitz. The opera was completed without the overture on
August 29, 1823. Weber began to compose the overture on September 1,
1823, and completed it at Vienna on October 19 of that year. He
scored the overture at Vienna, October 16-19, 1823.</p>
<p>Weber wrote to his wife on the day after the first performance, &ldquo;My
reception, when I appeared in the orchestra, was the most enthusiastic
and brilliant that one could imagine. There was no end to it. At last
I gave the signal for the beginning. Stillness of death. The overture
was applauded madly; there was a demand for a repetition; but I
went ahead, so that the performance might not be too long drawn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max Maria von Weber, in the life of his father, gives a somewhat
different account. A grotesque incident occurred immediately before
the performance. There was a tumult in the parterre of the opera
house. There was laughing, screaming, cursing. A fat, carelessly dressed
woman, with a crushed hat and a shawl hanging from her shoulders,
was going from seat to seat, screaming out: &ldquo;Make room for me! I
am the poetess!&rdquo; It was Mme von Chezy, who had forgotten to bring
her ticket and was thus heroically attempting to find her seat. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_387">387</span>
laughter turned into applause when Weber appeared in the orchestra,
and the applause continued until the signal for the beginning was
given. &ldquo;The performance of the overture,&rdquo; says Max von Weber, &ldquo;was
not worthy of the usually excellent orchestra; indeed, it was far inferior
to that at the dress rehearsal. Perhaps the players were too
anxious to do well, or, and this is more probable, perhaps the fault was
in the lack of sufficient rehearsal. The ensemble was faulty&mdash;in some
places the violins actually played false&mdash;and, although a repetition was
demanded by some, the impression made by the poetic composition
was not to be compared with that made later in Berlin, Dresden, and
the Gewandhaus concert in Leipsic.&rdquo; Yet Max von Weber says later
that Count Br&uuml;hl wrote the composer, January 18, 1824, that the overture
played for the first time in Berlin in a concert by F. L. Seidel
hardly made any impression at all. To this Weber answered, January
23: &ldquo;That the overture failed is naturally very unpleasant for me.
It must have been wholly misplayed, which I am led to believe from
the remarks about its difficulty. The Vienna orchestra, which is in no
way as good as that of Berlin, performed it <i>prima vista</i> without any
jar to my satisfaction, and, as it seemed, with effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The overture begins E flat, <i>allegro marcato, con molto fuoco</i>, 4-4,
though the half note is the metronomic standard indicated by Weber.
After eight measures of an impetuous and brilliant exordium the first
theme is announced by wind instruments in full harmony, and it is
derived from Adolar&rsquo;s phrase: &ldquo;<i>Ich bau&rsquo; auf Gott und meine Euryanth&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;
(Act I, No. 4). The original tonality is preserved. This theme
is developed brilliantly until, after a crashing chord, B flat, of full
orchestra and vigorous drumbeats, a transitional phrase for violoncellos
leads to the second theme, which is of a tender nature. Sung
by the first violins over sustained harmony in the other strings, this
theme is associated in the opera with the words, &ldquo;<i>O Seligkeit, dich
fass&rsquo; ich kaum!</i>&rdquo; from Adolar&rsquo;s air, &ldquo;<i>Wehen mir L&uuml;fte Ruh&rsquo;</i>&rdquo; (Act II,
No. 12). The measures of the exordium return, there is a strong
climax, and then after a long organ-point there is silence.</p>
<p>The succeeding short <i>largo</i>, charged with mystery, refers to Eglantine&rsquo;s
vision of Emma&rsquo;s ghost and to the fatal ring. Eglantine has taken
refuge in the castle of Nevers and won the affection of Euryanthe,
who tells her the tragic story of Emma and her betrothed, Udo; for
the ghost of Emma, sister of Adolar, had appeared to Euryanthe and
told her that Udo had been her faithful lover. He fell in battle. As
<span class="pb" id="Page_388">388</span>
life was to her then worthless, she took poison from a ring, and was
thereby separated from Udo; a wretched ghost, she was doomed to
wander by night until the ring should be wet with the tears shed by an
innocent maiden in her time of danger and extreme need (Act I,
No. 6). Eglantine steals the ring from the sepulcher. She gives it to
Lysiart, who shows it to the Court, swearing that he had received it
from Euryanthe, false to Adolar. The music is also heard in part in
Act III (No. 23), where Eglantine, about to marry Lysiart, sees in the
madness of sudden remorse the ghost of Emma, and soon after reveals
the treachery.</p>
<p>In <i>Euryanthe</i>, as in the old story of G&eacute;rard de Nevers, in the tale
told by Boccaccio, and in <i>Cymbeline</i>, a wager is made over a woman&rsquo;s
chastity. In each story the boasting lover or husband is easily persuaded
to jealousy and revenge by the villain bragging of favors granted to
him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For these three overtures, Weber used the customary orchestration of wood-winds
in twos, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, kettledrums, and
strings.&mdash;<span class="smaller">EDITOR.</span></p>

<p>It is doubtful whether without the title and descriptive programme
a hearer, as the music was playing, would say, &ldquo;Aha!
London&mdash;I hear the Thames, the roar and bustle of the streets.
Now we are in foggy, dismal Bloomsbury. Let&rsquo;s go to the Thames
Embankment. And now we see the march of the unemployed.&rdquo;
No. The austere, remote Delius wrote a symphonic poem <i>Paris</i>,
which is anything but the Paris of <i>Louise</i>, and might be Rouen,
Belfast, or Terre Haute.</p>
<p>A critic in London reproached Williams for introducing in this
symphony a theme too much like the notes of &ldquo;Have a banana!&rdquo;
from a song. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll All Go Down the Strand,&rdquo; a popular music-hall
ditty in the London of 1897. Perhaps Williams did this deliberately
for the sake of &ldquo;local color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony contains pages of great worth. The first two
movements are the richest in musical thought and in powerful expression.
<span class="pb" id="Page_390">390</span>
The idea of sleeping London is admirably brought out,
and the contrast with London awake is symphonically, not merely
theatrically, dramatic. The second movement is an excellent example
of tonal painting. It seems to us that the succeeding movements
lack varied and contrasting coloring. The &ldquo;Hunger March&rdquo;
of the unemployed is disappointing. The subject called for a Hector
Berlioz. The epilogue is of a higher flight of imagination. On
the whole, the symphony is an important contribution to orchestral
literature, one of the most important&mdash;and they have not been
many&mdash;in a dozen years.</p>
<div class="img"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="" width="40" height="40" /></div>
<p>This symphony was composed in 1912-13. The first performance
was at one of F. B. Ellis&rsquo;s concerts in Queen&rsquo;s Hall, London, on
March 27, 1914. Geoffrey Toye was the conductor. On May 4, 1920,
the revised version of the symphony was brought out at Queen&rsquo;s Hall,
London, at a concert of the British Music Society. Albert Coates conducted.
This performance was said to be the fourth. It was also said
that the symphony had been &ldquo;shortened a good deal, particularly at
the closes of the movements, on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following description by Mr. Coates of the symphony was published
in the bulletin of the society:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first movement opens at daybreak by the river. Old Father
Thames flows calm and silent under the heavy gray dawn, deep and
thoughtful, shrouded in mystery. London sleeps, and in the hushed
stillness of early morning one hears Big Ben (the Westminster chimes)
solemnly strike the half-hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly the scene changes (<i>allegro</i>); one is on the Strand in the
midst of the bustle and turmoil of morning traffic. This is London
street life of the early hours&mdash;a steady stream of foot passengers hurrying,
newspaper boys shouting, messengers whistling, and that most
typical sight of London streets, the costermonger (Coster &rsquo;Arry), resplendent
in pearl buttons, and shouting some coster song refrain at
the top of a raucous voice, returning from Covent Garden Market,
seated on his vegetable barrow drawn by the inevitable little donkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for a few moments one turns off the Strand into one of the
quiet little streets that lead down to the river and suddenly the noise
<span class="pb" id="Page_391">391</span>
ceases, shut off as though by magic. We are in the part of London
known as the Adelphi. Formerly the haunt of fashionable bucks and
dandies about town, now merely old-fashioned houses and shabby old
streets, haunted principally by beggars and ragged street urchins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We return to the Strand and are once again caught up by the bustle
and life of London&mdash;gay, careless, noisy, with every now and then a
touch of something fiercer, something inexorable&mdash;as though one felt
for a moment the iron hand of the great city&mdash;yet, nevertheless, full
of that mixture of good-humor, animal spirits, and sentimentality that
is so characteristic of London.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Second Movement</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In the second movement the composer paints us a picture of that
region of London which lies between Holborn and the Euston Road,
known as Bloomsbury. Dusk is falling. It is the damp and foggy twilight
of a late November day. Those who know their London know
this region of melancholy streets over which seems to brood an air of
shabby gentility&mdash;a sad dignity of having seen better days. In the
gathering gloom there is something ghostlike. A silence hangs over the
neighborhood broken only by the policeman on his beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is tragedy, too, in Bloomsbury, for among the many streets
between Holborn and Euston there are alleys of acute poverty and
worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In front of a &lsquo;pub&rsquo; whose lights flare through the murky twilight
stands an old musician playing the fiddle. His tune is played in the
orchestra by the viola. In the distance the &lsquo;lavender cry&rsquo; is heard: &lsquo;Sweet
lavender; who&rsquo;ll buy sweet lavender?&rsquo; Up and down the street the cry
goes, now nearer, now farther away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gloom deepens and the movement ends with the old musician
still playing his pathetic little tune.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Third Movement</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;In this movement one must imagine one&rsquo;s self sitting late on a
Saturday night on one of the benches of the Temple Embankment
(that part of the Thames Embankment lying between the Houses of
Parliament and Waterloo Bridge). On our side of the river all is
quiet, and in the silence one hears from a distance coming from the
other side of the river all the noises of Saturday night in the slums.
<span class="pb" id="Page_392">392</span>
(The &lsquo;other&rsquo; side, the south side of the river Thames, is a vast network
of very poor quarters and slums.) On a Saturday night these
slums resemble a fair; the streets are lined with barrows, lit up by
flaming torches, selling cheap fruit, vegetables, produce of all kinds;
the streets and alleys are crowded with people. At street corners coster
girls in large feather hats dance their beloved &lsquo;double-shuffle jig&rsquo; to the
accompaniment of a mouth organ. We seem to hear distant laughter;
also every now and then what sounds like cries of suffering. Suddenly
a concertina breaks out above the rest; then we hear a few bars on a
hurdy-gurdy organ. All this softened by distance, melted into one vast
hum, floats across the river to us as we sit meditating on the Temple
Embankment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music changes suddenly, and one feels the Thames flowing
silent, mysterious, with a touch of tragedy. One of London&rsquo;s sudden
fogs comes down, making Slumland and its noises seem remote. Again,
for a few bars, we feel the Thames flowing through the night, and
the picture fades into fog and silence.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Fourth Movement</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The last movement deals almost entirely with the cruder aspect of
London, the London of the unemployed and unfortunate. After the
opening bars we hear the &lsquo;Hunger March&rsquo;&mdash;a ghostly march past of
those whom the city grinds and crushes, the great army of those who
are cold and hungry and unable to get work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hear again the noise and bustle of the streets (reminiscences
of the first movement), but these now also take on the cruder aspect.
There are sharp discords in the music. This is London as seen by the
man who is &lsquo;out and under.&rsquo; The man &lsquo;out of a job&rsquo; who watches the
other man go whistling to his work, the man who is starving, watching
the other man eat&mdash;and the cheerful, bustling picture of gay street
life becomes distorted, a nightmare seen by the eyes of suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music ends abruptly, and in the short silence that follows one
again hears Big Ben chiming from Westminster Tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There follows the epilogue, in which we seem to feel the great,
deep soul of London&mdash;London as a whole, vast and unfathomable&mdash;and
the symphony ends as it began, with the river, old Father Thames
flowing calm and silent, as he has flowed through the ages, the keeper
of many secrets, shrouded in mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_393">393</div>
<p>And yet the composer has been quoted as saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The title might run <i>A Symphony by a Londoner</i>&mdash;that is to say,
various sights and sounds of London may have influenced the composer,
but it would not be helpful to describe these. The work must
succeed or fail as music, and in no other way. Therefore, if the hearers
recognize a few suggestions of such things as the Westminster chimes,
or the lavender cry, these must be treated as accidents and not
essentials of the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symphony is dedicated &ldquo;to the memory of George Butterworth,&rdquo;
a young composer of great promise, Lieutenant of the Durham
Light Infantry, who was killed on August 5, 1916, &ldquo;after successfully
taking an enemy trench at the head of a bombing party.&rdquo; It is scored
for these instruments: three flutes (and piccolo), two oboes, English
horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, double bassoon, four
horns, two trumpets, two <i>cornets-&agrave;-pistons</i>, three trombones, bass tuba,
a set of three kettledrums, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle,
jingles (the little cymbals, or plates, fixed in the wooden hoop of a
tambourine), tam-tam, glockenspiel, two harps, and strings.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
